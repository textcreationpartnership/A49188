            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER, I. <hi>The Occaſion and Deſign of this Paper.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Apoſtle's Injunction (alone) of <hi>Proving all things,</hi> doth Apologize for and Juſtify the following Undertaking. The Deſign whereof, as will appear, is not to ſet up the <hi>Socinian</hi> or <hi>Arian</hi> Sentiments, but further to Vindicate what on an unſhakable Foundation I have heretofore aſſerted concerning the Neceſſity of Moderation with reſpect to theſe moſt Intricate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, and to confirm the Scripture-Method of Union which I have Pleaded for in "the Apology for the <hi>Irenicum Magnum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No Man can ſay, that there are no Difficulties in the Holy Scriptures, or that there are there no Articles obſcurely deliver'd. For who is he that will pretend he Infallibly underſtands every thing ſpoken of in the Bible? If any ſhould ask, to what purpoſe the Scripture ſhould make mention of ſuch Matters, as are ſuppos'd ſo very Obſcure and Difficult, that it is not ſafe nor prudent Magiſterially to make expreſs Determinations concerning them; I have anſwer'd, that probably it is, to prove our Sincerity and Induſtry, (to try whether we will take the Pains ſeriouſly and diligently to conſider what Meaſures in reaſon are here beſt to be followed in ſuch Intricate Caſes,) and ſo to exerciſe our Humility and our Moderation. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly theſe Obſcure Matters will be more fully diſcover'd hereafter, and it ſeems God judgeth it will ſuffice that we be then moſt clearly inform'd of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:37508:5"/>It is an ancient Saying, that the Holy Scripture is like a River, which a Lamb may wade, and wherein Elephants may ſomtimes be forced to ſwim. That is to ſay; Thoſe that deſire no other but to work out their Salvation, as the caſe is with men of ordinary Capacities, may compaſs their deſign in the uſe of God's Word, for they will find therein very clearly whatſoever is abſolutely Neceſſary for them: But the greateſt Scholars, that would fain know every thing, and that are bound to inquire as far as they can, will often be at a loſs and ſhall not find themſelves able to dive to the bottom of ſeveral Particulars, tho' they be Men of the ſharpeſt Wit, as well as of the deepeſt Learning; witneſs eſpecially many Paſſages in the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> or <hi>Revelations.</hi> Wherefore 'tis evident, ſuch difficult Matters ought not to be Magiſterially determin'd, not tho' in their true Senſe: The taking of them determinately in ſuch a Senſe, ought not to be impos'd, or made part of the Terms of Communion. For theſe things being ſo very Difficult, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and Inquiſitive Men may miſtake and differ about 'em, what ſeems then ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently clear to one ſometimes ſeeming otherwiſe to another, and no one having right to decide Magiſterially in ſuch Caſes more than another; and it is credible, if the explicit knowledg and belief of theſe things had been Indiſpenſibly and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally neceſſary, God would have reveal'd them more diſtinctly and expreſly.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle has this Expreſſion, <hi>tho I underſtood all Myſteries.</hi> Which is an evident Argument, that there are Myſteries in Religion, which the eminenteſt Chriſtians may misunderſtand, or not know how to determine. And in the 14th. of the <hi>Romans</hi> the ſame Apoſtle ſhews, that good Men may <hi>doubt,</hi> and be of <hi>different Sentiments,</hi> in ſome Caſes.</p>
               <p>Now what do I propoſe as <hi>then</hi> fit to be done, but what the Apoſtle <hi>there</hi> expreſly enjoins, and is manifeſtly agreable to the charitable and moderate Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Chriſtianity, and to the eſſential and avow'd Principles of Proteſtants?</p>
               <p>I ſay, that in <hi>moſt abſtruſe</hi> and <hi>intricate</hi> Points, about which <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive</hi> Perſons may miſtake and differ, we muſt not judge and reject one another, but muſt <hi>unite</hi> in the utmoſt <hi>Generality</hi> of the very Expreſſions of <hi>Scripture.</hi> The Reaſonableneſs and Neceſſity of which <hi>Method of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> I have evinced, in the (aforementioned) <hi>Irenicum Magnum,</hi> and it's <hi>Apology.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be ask'd how it ſhall be known, who are <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>inquiſitive</hi> Perſons, or what Points are ſo <hi>abſtruſe</hi> and <hi>intricate;</hi> I anſwer, that muſt be judg'd of by <hi>the Arguments</hi> of the different Parties. And hereby I infer, that <hi>Trinitarians</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> ought to <hi>bear with one another,</hi> and ſo to order their <hi>Terms of Church-Communion</hi> as <hi>not</hi> to be a <hi>Stumbling-Block</hi> to or as not to fright away <hi>either</hi> of them, becauſe actually <hi>both of them</hi> bring ſo conſiderable <hi>Arguments</hi> in behalf of their Opinions, that tis obvious <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>conſidering</hi> Perſons may not always be able to ſatisfy themſelves which Side is moſt infallibly or moſt credibly Certain; and, after all, when God is worſhipped, all is inconteſtably ador'd that is the Object of Divine Worſhip: We are expreſly commanded but to Pray directly to God in the Name or as the Diſciples of Chriſt, who hope to be heard for the ſake of Chriſt and thro' his moſt acceptable Interceſſion; and certainly as for Chriſt's Humanity, it being a Creature and the Mediator between God and Men, it is to be honour'd with a Mediatory or Inferior Honour, As for the reſt, (which, then, if rightly taken, would be but a Speculative Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37508:5"/>the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> with ſeeming good cauſe, are perſuaded, that <hi>their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> are <hi>not deſpicable:</hi> And in the <hi>Apologia pro Irenico Magno</hi> it is ſhewn, that <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Arguments</hi> are <hi>far from being inconſidorable.</hi> I do therefore conclude for <hi>Mutual Forbearance, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> upon the General Terms aforeſaid. For upon the Evidence of both Sides, I conceive, that this is a Controverſy, in which Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being Faulty may miſtake.</p>
               <p>But againſt this my Sentiment, ſome Object, that that cannot be, becauſe <hi>ſome Texts of Scripture</hi> ſeem <hi>most Expreſs</hi> againſt the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> and particularly <hi>the Beginning of</hi> St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Goſpel.</hi> It is therefore very juſt to conſider what the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians ſay to thoſe Texts. I might content my ſelf to refer the Reader to their <hi>Brief Hiſtory,</hi> a Shilling Book, to be had at moſt Bookſellers, wherein the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Texts of Scripture, Objected to them, are Explain'd, from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Revelation.</hi> But in farther Vindication of my Propoſal of <hi>the Scripture-Method of Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> I am willing to give here <hi>an Enſample</hi> of <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> to ſhew what they <hi>Anſwer</hi> in general to the <hi>Objection</hi> from <hi>this</hi> Topic. And, becauſe <hi>the Beginning of the Goſpel of</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> is commonly reckoned to be moſt Deciſive againſt them, I have particularly pitched upon that, to repreſent moſt evidently that even here they want not ſomthing to ſay for themſelves that is probable enough, tho it be not pretended that the Controverſy is thereby wholly clear'd from all manner of <hi>Difficulty.</hi> They that approve not that things be thus offer'd to be conſider'd, run to the implicit and ſlaviſh Faith of the Romaniſts, and take away that Liberty, which not only the Principles of Proteſtants allow of and recommend, but which is neceſſary to debate and examine difficult Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to attain with rational aſſurance to the Truth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. II. <hi>The</hi> Socinian <hi>Explication of the Beginning of St.</hi> John's <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ST. <hi>John</hi> begins thus his Goſpel. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Socinians</hi> eſteem, that the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians underſtood theſe terms according to this Syſtem.</p>
               <p>Verſe, 1. <hi>In the Beginning.</hi> The Chriſtian Oeconomy being founded upon the Mediation of Chriſt, (on the account of his being appointed thereunto, and of his being a Man perfectly Innocent, and Obedient, even unto Death,) and not only Fallen Men being granted to the Meſſiah, but all Creatures in Heaven and Earth being ſubjected unto him, upon the Conditions of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; the Reformation, or New-Modelling of things, by that Illuſtrious Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, is compared to the Old Creation deſcribed in the 1ſt. Chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> If God had not reſolved to have ſent a Redeemer, and if the New Covenant had not taken place of the Firſt Eſtabliſhment, the Race of Mankind had periſhed.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37508:6"/>Therefore the Saving it is figuratively repreſented as Creating of it anew, by the glorious Performance of the Bleſſed Jeſus, the Lamb in God's Preſcience and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination Slain from the Foundation of the World. For when <hi>Adam</hi> fell, God made a Reſolution to ſend a new Man, aſſiſted of the Spirit without meaſure, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in all points by the Eternal Wiſdom what to do and ſuffer to make a Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Divine Authority and to obtain the chief place in God's Favour, and on conſideration of his perfect Obedience and undeſerved Sufferings conſtituted the King of Men and Angels, and exalted to a Participation of the Divine Power, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to work for him at his holy Requeſt, that he might be enabled to Save to the uttermoſt thoſe that truely Repent and Turn unto God. Wherefore God made a Gracious Promiſe to our Firſt Parents, and from that moment admitted them to Repentance. But tho' theſe were the Effects of God's Reſolution of ſending Chriſt into the World, and even then the Goſpel began in ſome meaſure to dawn neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the grand Operation and Manifeſtation of it was not then made, Chriſt was not yet Born, and conſequently not Perſonally entered upon his Office. The Firſt Age of the World therefore, tho' it was the beginning of the New Covenant granted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt's account, yet is not expreſly reckon'd here as the beginning of Chriſt's Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy. That is taken properly to commence many Ages after, when the Saviour of the World was come in Perſon, to do the will of God, and to Reform and New-model all things. Then it is that there is repreſented as it were a New Creation made. Our Evangeliſt ſais, at the 3d. Ver. of this Chap. that all things were made by Jeſus Chriſt. VVhich the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> thus expreſſes; <hi>By his Son God made the Worlds, Heb.</hi> 1, 2. And in the 5th. Verſe of the 2d. Chapter of the ſame Epiſtle, as in all the four Goſpels, it is declared what thoſe VVorlds were, and what that Creation was. Seeing then that the Chriſtian Oeconomy is uſhered in under the Image of a Creation, it is no wonder that the Evangeliſt, alluding to the Hiſtory of the Old Creation, begins his Goſpel as <hi>Moſes</hi> doth his Firſt Chapter of the <hi>Geneſis</hi> by theſe VVords, <hi>In the beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it inconteſtably appears, by the 1ſt. and 2d. Verſes of the 1st. Chapter of St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s Goſpel, what that beginning was; Namely <hi>the beginning of Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> which is there ſhewn to have begun when the Meſſiah was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the World by his immediate Harbinger <hi>John the Baptiſt.

For, we ſee, St. <hi>Mark</hi> calls that the beginning of the Goſpel. And thus 'tis evident St. <hi>John</hi> begins his Hiſtory by our Saviour's Inſtalment or his Entering into his Office, which was at that time, when <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was Baptizing, and when our Saviour, being Thirty Years Old, was Baptized of him.</p>

Thus <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> (in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.) interprets it. <q>Seeing Chriſt is call'd <hi>the Light</hi> by reaſon of his Enlightning the World, it is plain He is call'd <hi>the Word</hi> upon the Account of his Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

He was Solemnly conſtituted the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> He was appointed the Chief of the Chief of the Arch-angels as well as of the reſt of the Angels. He was made partaker, as much as poſſible, of the Divine Nature, and particularly of the Divine Wiſdom, and Divine Power, on certain conditions; only his fuller communicating to others the Divine Spirit, was reſerv'd to his actual Reigning in Heaven, after his Reſurrection and moſt Glorious Aſcenſion. In a word, He was declared to be, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the performing of his Undertaking, the Heir and Lord of every Creature. He was then, on theſe Terms, Proclaim'd God's Firſt Miniſter. He was thus, even then, made a <hi>Prince,</hi> a <hi>Lord,</hi> a <hi>Sovereign, acting for God, and by God's Commiſſion.</hi> And that is what the term, <hi>God,</hi> often ſignifies in <hi>Scripture.</hi> That moſt Noble and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Name</hi> is there given to <hi>Perſons, commiſſionated by God, in moſt eminent Stations,</hi> not only becauſe they are <hi>God's Chief Miniſters,</hi> but becauſe, <hi>acting for</hi> and as it were in the ſtead of <hi>God, they do in ſome meaſure repreſent Him.</hi> We ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.21. that the <hi>Angel,</hi> that conducted the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had that High Name and Dignity; <hi>for,</hi> ſays God, <hi>my Name is in Him.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This Text may put us in mind, or cauſe us to obſerve, that (as we ſhall ſee was remark'd by <hi>Euſebius Pamphilus, De Eccleſiaſtie. Theolog. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 17.) St. <hi>John's</hi> Expreſſion which we are conſidering ſhould not be rendered <hi>the Word was God,</hi> but <hi>the Word was a God;</hi> there being no <hi>Article</hi> here before the Term <hi>God,</hi> (as there was in the foregoing Sentence where it was ſaid that the Word <hi>was with God,</hi> which Sentence therefore ſhould have been Tranſlated <hi>was with the God</hi> by excellency, or the Supreme God, the Sovereign of all.) This Paſſage of St. <hi>John</hi> would appear more eaſy to our Apprehenſion, if inſtead of the term <hi>God</hi> we did read <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>Sovereign,</hi> becauſe in the Stile of our Modern Languages we are not uſed to appropriate the Title of <hi>God</hi> to any Creatures as the Scripture doth, but are only wont to give the Appellation of <hi>Lord,</hi> in common, tho' in divers Senſes, to God and to ſome Great Men in Authority. Thus then we may conceive the Firſt Verſe of St. <hi>John's</hi> Goſpel to run, according to its true Signification. <q>In the beginning of the New Oeconomy, while <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> was Preaching the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Repentance as the immediate Introduction of the New Diſpenſation, the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> himſelf was then in the World; And the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was with the Lord, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was with the Angel in the Mountain before the giving of the Law; And the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was then conſtituted a Sovereign Lord, or the Chief of thoſe Princely Miniſters and High Officers who have the Title of <hi>Lord</hi> or <hi>God</hi> communicated to them, tho' in an Inferior Senſe to what it imports when it is attributed to the Eternal and Supreme Lord of all.</q> 
                  <hi>And the Word was with the God, and the Word was a God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Saviour himſelf obſerves, <hi>John</hi> 10.34. that the Title of <hi>God</hi> was given to <hi>Men</hi> in the Holy Scripture: <hi>Is it not written in your Law, I ſaid, Ye are Gods? If He called them Gods, unto whom the Word of God came,</hi> (or to whom God gave a High Commiſſion,) <hi>and the Scripture cannot be broken; ſay ye of Him whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther has Sanctified and Sent into the World, Thou Blaſphemeſt; becauſe I ſaid, I am the Son of God?</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:37508:8"/>We muſt needs then ever remember, that the Stile of Scripture differs from ours, and that we muſt not Interpret every thing according to the Sound of Words, but conſiſtently with the whole Scripture and the clear notions of Reaſon. <hi>Verba non Sono ſed Senſu ſapiunt,</hi> is an excellent Rule, and a Sentence of St. <hi>Hilary</hi>'s, quoted in Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Second Sermon upon <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.7.</p>
               <p>A notable Example of the Title of <hi>God</hi> being given to <hi>Men</hi> is that of the 45th. <hi>Pſ.</hi> at the 6. and 7. Ver. where the Author of this Pſalm addreſſes himſelf thus to <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> upon his Marriage with Pharach's Daughter, and his being declared <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Heir of the Kingdom</hi> by his Father <hi>David. Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever: Thou loveſt Righteouſneſs and hateſt Wickedneſs; wherefore, O God, thy God has vnointed thee with the Oyl of Gladneſs above thy Fellows.</hi> Here <hi>Solomon</hi> is expreſly called <hi>God.</hi> It is undoubted that this Pſalm in a myſtical Senſe is applicable to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and to his Spiritual Marriage with the Church. But the myſtical and ſecundary doth not take away the firſt and literal Senſe. And it would be moſt Unreaſonable to pretend that this Pſalm has no literal Signification. It appears to be the uſual way of the Holy Spirit, under the Old Teſtament, to Shadow the things pertaining to the Chriſtian Oeconomy by real Acts or literal Events then ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified or belonging to thoſe times under the former Diſpenſations. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we find all the reaſon in the World, to aſcribe a literal Senſe to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical and myſtical Pſalm, and to underſtand it primarily or originally of the ſaid Wedding of <hi>King Solomon.</hi> We find it has always been generally ſo underſtood. We find it as ſitting for that Solemnity as it could be ſuppoſed to have been if it had been made for it; and we ſee it is entituled <hi>a Song of Love,</hi> or a Wedding Poem. The Prince is repreſented as having his Title newly confer'd upon and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured to him, and as being preferred before his Fellows or Brethren, by his <hi>God</hi> or <hi>King.</hi> This ſuits very well with <hi>Solomons</hi> Caſe, and with the <hi>Secinian</hi> Syſtem. But it is inconſiſtent with the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Notions, as much as <hi>the Trinitarian Interpretation</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Truth of the Divine Unity. For if there be but one God, can it be ſaid to Him <hi>thy God has,</hi> &amp;c? If the term <hi>God</hi> be here taken in the moſt eminent Senſe of it, there are <hi>two Supreme Gods;</hi> the one ſpoken to, and the other ſpoken of and ſaid to be the God of him that is ſpoken to; and ſo a Supreme or Eternal and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God has a God that is his Superior, or, which implies the ſame thing, has a God that is his God and that confers Honours and Benefits upon him; which is an Abſurdity, no leſs than that of ſuppoſing two abſolutely Supreme or Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Gods. Beſides, a <hi>God,</hi> in the moſt eminent Senſe of the word, cannot be ſaid to be <hi>anointed.</hi> For either his Deity is not true, (or not truely perfect in it ſelf, and ſo not abſolutely divine,) or elſe it is all-ſufficient, and can need no anointing. Even a Man Perſonally-United with God, if that were poſſible, cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be anointed with the Aſſiſting Spirit, ſeeing he cannot need it; for ſuch a Perſon muſt needs have in himſelf all that is Great and Neceſſary. Howbeit, it is <hi>the God</hi> that is here ſpoken to: <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>God,</hi> in fine, has no <hi>Fellows.</hi> Nor even has a <hi>God-Man Fellows,</hi> except there be more <hi>God-Men,</hi> as there were more <hi>Kings Sons</hi> beſides <hi>Solomon.</hi> For all theſe reaſons, therefore, thoſe words of this Pſalm cannot be underſtood as the Adverſaries of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> would underſtand them; and it doth then appear, that another is called

                  <hi>God,</hi> beſides the <hi>Supreme God.</hi> And ſo it is to no purpoſe here to Object, that we do not read of any Children by <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Daughter, and that the Kingdom was not of long continuance in <hi>Solomon's</hi> Family, as we ſuppoſe is here promiſed. Firſt, theſe might be the Pſalmiſts Wiſhes, which were very natural on that Occaſion, and ſeemed requiſite, <hi>ex Epithalamii lege,</hi> ſays <hi>Rivetus.</hi> But beſides that, there are frequently in Scripture Conditional Promiſes, even when the Condition is but Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely underſtood and not expreſſed. And thus it might be promiſed to <hi>Solomon,</hi> that his Throne would be for ever, or that the Kingdom would be of a very long Continuance in his Family, in Caſe he and his Children remained true to their Duty. (<hi>Pſ.</hi> 132.13.) In like manner <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Daughter might here be promiſed many Children, who would have been accounted Great Lords and Princes in all the Land of <hi>Judea</hi> and in all the Coaſts of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> And the Reaſon why that Promiſe took no effect, might be becauſe ſhe revolted to the Idolatry which undoubtedly ſhe had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured at her Marriage. At the 10th. and 11th. Verſes, the Pſalmiſt addreſſes himſelf thus to the Queen: <hi>Hearken, O Daughter; forget thine own People and thy Fathers Houſe; ſo ſhall the King greatly deſire thy Beauty.</hi> Doth not this Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appear very Suitable to a Princeſs come out of an Idolatrous Family? And at the ſame time doth it not hereby appear, that She is Married to a Prince in whoſe Country Idolatry was not the National Religion? What Country that was, is evident. And it is added in the following Verſe, that the City of <hi>Tyre,</hi> famous for her Rich Trading, would bring Preſents to the Queen. Which Suits well with <hi>Solomens</hi> proſperous Reign. It muſt then be Unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that this Pſalm has not a literal Senſe, or that that is not the literal Senſe thereof, which ſo well Suits with it, and which, as was obſerved, has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been reputed to be its primary meaning by the Generality of the beſt and moſt learned Interpreters in all Parties. There is therefore viſibly all the Reaſon in the World to believe, that it is <hi>Solomon</hi> that is here called <hi>God.</hi> And why ſhould any (tho' but the leaſt number) among the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> be ſo averſe to own it; or what need is there to be at ſo much pains to put that matter out of doubt? Are not <hi>Great Men,</hi> in other Places of Scripture, ſaid to be <hi>Gods? I have ſaid, ye are Gods, Pſ.</hi> 82.6. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 138.1. and 4. &amp;c. Why then ſhould not <hi>Solomon</hi> here be called <hi>God,</hi> that is, <hi>a Sovereign Prince, acting for God, by Gods expreſs Commiſſion to that purpoſe, and ſo in ſome meaſure or in ſome reſpects repreſenting God.</hi> Have we not ſeen that our Saviour himſelf obſerved it, that <hi>they are called Gods unto whom the Word of God came?</hi> (<hi>John.</hi> 10.35.) And at what occaſion did our Saviour make that Obſervation? That alſo, to the purpoſe before us, is well worth the being noted. It was when the <hi>Jews</hi> reproached to him, that he Equalled himſelf to God, and, as they judged, made himſelf the Moſt High God. And now what doth he Anſwer to that Charge? Doth he ſay, that he was literally the Eternal God, and that a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Divine Perſon was incarnate in him; or doth he leave any Room for any ſuch conceit, or rather do's he not expreſly obviate and refute it? This is manifeſtly the whole meaning of his Anſwer. <q>Why ſhould you think, that I make my ſelf the Moſt High God? Is it becauſe I am called <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>the Son of God?</hi> And don't you know that in your own Law it is written of ſome Great Men, <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods and the Sons of the Higheſt?</hi> Were thoſe Men therefore to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted

How can ye then ſay of Me, that I Blaſpheme, becauſe what I ſay, implies, I am the Moſt High God?</q>

               <p>BUT it is time to go on to what remains to be explained of the beginning of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel. We have done with the Firſt Verſe, wherein it is generally thought there lies the greateſt Difficulty. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</hi> That laſt Clauſe, <hi>the Word was God,</hi> may ſeem to moſt of us the hardeſt expreſſion; that was of ſpeaking not being uſual with us, as was obſerved. But at the ſame time we have ſeen, that the Scripture calls Kings and Great Men <hi>Gods:</hi> I <hi>have ſaid Ye are Gods.</hi> We have no reaſon therefore to think it ſtrange, that the Meſſiah, the Higheſt Officer in the World, <hi>the Prince of Men and Angels,</hi> and the King of Kings, ſhould be alſo honoured there with the moſt Illuſtrious Title that was ever given to any in the moſt eminent Station, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37508:9"/>be accordingly called <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>a God,</hi> or <hi>Sovereign Lord.</hi> The Scripture <hi>called them Gods, unto whom the Word of God came. John,</hi> 10.35. That is to ſay, thoſe whom God made his Chief Officers, and to whom God gave Commandment and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to act in ſome meaſure in his ſtead. Thus it appears Chriſt might well be called God; (the Mediatory Kingdom of the Univerſe being given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im, or he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made the Sovereign of all under the Father:) Which being ſet into ſo great a light, we need but to paraphraſe a few Verſes more, and give ſome reaſons for our Expoſition of one Expreſſion or two therein.</p>
               <p>Verſe 3. All that concerns the Eſtabliſhment of the Chriſtian Oeconomy, and of the Chriſtian Church, (which is the New Creation,) has been dene by Chriſt, and by his orders and procurement. Here on Earth, having Preached the Doctrin of Repentance by his immediate Precurſor and by his other Miniſters, (as he had even done in ſome meaſure before his Birth, by the Prophets and Patriarchs, for it was upon his account that God ſent them, the Meſſiah being before them in God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and they being therefore to be looked upon as the Meſſiah's Officers, and what the Officers do being to be aſcribed to him in whoſe Name or in whoſe Stead they act,) and himſelf having fully declared the nature and intendment of the Goſpel, He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up himſelf as a Sacrifice for our Sins to God; and thus, having laid the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Church, confirmed his Doctrin by his Reſurrection and innumerable Miracles, and Commiſſionated his Apoſtles and Chief Diſciples, (all which may be called the Building of his Houſe, which he purchaſed with his Blood,) He left this World. Being alcended into Heaven, He New-modelled things there too by his Preſence. He ordered and diſpoſed them on a new foot and in a new manner. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exalted at the right hand of God, He took poſſeſſion of his Dignity and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Sovereign Prince in the Heavenly Places. Angels were there then no longer God's Chief Miniſters, but were then moſt particularly ſubjected unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and He appointed them their Stations, or confirmed them in their Places and Offices, and He daily gives them orders and commiſſions, as he ſees beſt, for the Service of his Church and the Government of the Univerſe. (Yet it is not to be forgotten, that Chriſt is but a Mediatory or Subordinate King, having not his Kingdom of himſelf, but from the Father, and by the Fathers gift; wherefore the Honour to be paid to Chriſt is not direct or ultimate, but Inferior and Mediaro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to the Glory of the Father; Chriſt, tho' a Sovereign and the King of a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, being the Father's Subſtitute or Sub-delegate, and acting in the Father's Name, and by the Father's Power and Wiſdom: And therefore, he thus repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God at the Head of the Univerſe, we accordingly honour him, and worſhip the Divine Wiſdom and Power in him.)</p>
               <p>Verſe 4. In him was Life. God was with him, directed and aſſiſted him, and dwelt in him. By him, then, Life was procured to fallen Mankind. And the Light of his Doctrine, of his Works and Miracles, and of the Spirit, or Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, dwelling in and communicated by him, was the Life of Men: He brought Immortal Life to light thro the Goſpel; And God gave him Power to give E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life to his Obedient Diſciples.</p>
               <p>Verſe 9. That was the true Light, which, coming into the World, lighteth all Men, Jews and Gentiles. Our Saviour, when he appear'd in the World, did not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37508:10"/>deſign to inſtruct a particular Nation only, but purpoſed to ſet up ſuch a Light as might ſhine to the utmoſt Parts of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Verſe 10. This Great Meſſenger of God appear'd among Men, and Men were as it were a new Created by him, for He Redeemed the Race of Mankind with his Blood; yet the generality of Men perceived not that that Illuſtrious Perſon was Him whom God did ſet forth for their Saviour. Men loved Darkneſs rather than Light, tho' it was ſo abundantly and ſo mercifully offer'd them.</p>
               <p>Verſe 11. <hi>He came unto his own,</hi> &amp;c. If God had not intended to have given a Saviour to Men, as was ſaid, He would have deſtroyed this World; but having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, in the caſe of Man's F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe</hi> were then <hi>his own,</hi> moſt peculiarly.</p>
               <p>He <hi>made</hi> them: As it is ſaid, in the foregoing Verſe, he <hi>had made the World,</hi> (or the World was made by him) in that he preſerved them and all the World by his Undertaking; ſeeing that, without it, after <hi>Adam's</hi> Fall, Mankind had periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, like the fall'n Angels. He ought then truly to be conſidered as the Maker of Men, or as the Perſon from whom all fall'n Men held their Life and Being. And therefore without doubt, fall'n Men, and among them the <hi>Jews</hi> in particular, his Countrymen and the ſpecial People of God, may well be called <hi>his own.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>And his own received him not.</hi> Theſe Men, to whom were given the Divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and among whom Chriſt was born, and lived, and did mighty Works, and was baptized and proclaim'd the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> by <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> and by the <hi>Ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus the World knew him not and received him not, notwithſtanding all the Atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Heaven that this was their Maker, their Saviour, and the Mighty Prince that God deſign'd them.</p>
               <p>Verſe 14. <hi>And the Word</hi> WAS <hi>Fleſh.</hi> So we muſt render it, and not <hi>was made.</hi> It is the ſame Expreſſion that is uſed at the beginning of the 6th. Verſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>There</hi> WAS <hi>a Man ſent from God.</hi> If the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Sentiment was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible concerning three eternal and ſupremely Divine Perſons, as it expreſly ſeems to be, yet it could not truly be ſaid, that <hi>God was made Fleſh.</hi> But the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Sentiment appears to imply many expreſs Contradictions. It ſeems therefore every way againſt Reaſon to render this Text as the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> do. It muſt then be Tranſlated as we have done. For, as was obſerved, the term doth bear that Senſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:37508:10"/>
                  <hi>The Word was Fleſh. Fleſh;</hi> that is to ſay, <q>a mortal Man encompaſſed with all the infirmities, or appearing in the low form and meaneſt circumſtances, of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, (not implying Sin.)</q> See <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.20. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 12.12. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.50. <hi>That</hi> is then it ſeems of ſomewhat a greater force and ſignificancy than if the Evangeliſt had barely ſaid, that the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> was <hi>a Man;</hi> the ſaying that He was <hi>Fleſh,</hi> being as much as to ſay, that, as to his Nature and Being, he was <hi>but a Man,</hi> an ordinary Man, like other Men, a very Man, or true Man, made up of Soul and Body, ſubject to Want and Temptation, to Hunger and Thirſt, and to all the like Frailties and Accidents of Human Nature. (By the laſt quoted Texts it appears that this is imported by the term <hi>Fleſh,</hi> which in the Oriental Languages is a proper expreſſion to that purpoſe, tho' in our Tongue, like many other Scripture Phraſes, it ſeems odd; but we ought to remember, that the Bible was not originally written in Engliſh; we muſt therefore carefully attend to the ſtile of the Scripture, and explain one Place by another, that we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it right.)</p>
               <p>But tho' it be certain the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Prime Miniſter and Chief Meſſenger of God, was a poor mortal Man, ſubject to the Pains and Sufferings incident to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, from which miſerable ſtate and wretched circumſtances, being perfectly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, he might have been exempt, but to which, for the ſake of Men and for the Redemption of Mankind, he freely ſubjected himſelf; yet, as the Evangeliſt at the ſame time doth here obſerve, he was not without ſome conſpicuous and moſt illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Rays of Glory, the Glory of being own'd by God for the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Glory of bringing and procuring the moſt excellent Revelation, and the Glory of working as great and as many Miracles as he pleas'd, and when he pleas'd, ſuch a Glory as declared that the Father dwelt conſtantly in him, and as beſpoke him to be the great Meſſenger or divine Word, and the only-begotten or moſt beloved Son, of God. Such a Glory was ſeen in him; as the Glory of the Son of God, or as a Glory worthy of the Son of God by excellency. Nevertheleſs, to all other outward appearances and circumſtances, he was content to be as the meaneſt and moſt contemptible Men. <hi>And the Word was Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it was very pertinent to the Deſign of the Evangeliſt, to uſe that expreſſion. For it ſeems to be his chief Aim, to ſhew that Chriſt the Word was but a Man. It is commonly thought, that he wrote his Goſpel purpoſely to oppoſe the Hereſies of <hi>Cerinthus.</hi> We are told, (<hi>Iren. L.</hi> 1. <hi>C.</hi> 25. and <hi>Euſeb. L.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 25.) <hi>Cerinthus</hi> maintained, that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> born of <hi>Mary,</hi> was not <hi>the Word</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but that <hi>the Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>the Logos,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>the Word,</hi> the Divine Meſſenger, or Wiſdom, or Proclaimer of the Wiſdom of God, was an <hi>Hypoſtaſis,</hi> or real <hi>Perſon,</hi> ſubſiſting of it ſelf, an <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Subſtance, different from <hi>Jeſus,</hi> but dwelling in him while he was on Earth, and working wondrous Works by him. Now in oppoſition to this, St. <hi>John</hi> aſſerts that <hi>the Word was Fleſh,</hi> was <hi>truly a Man,</hi> and <hi>but a Man,</hi> a <hi>frail mortal Man, like other Men,</hi> tho' indeed the moſt dignified of all Creatures, as he declares at the Firſt Verſe, where he calls him <hi>a God,</hi> which is the Higheſt Name that <hi>Cerin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> gave to <hi>the Word.</hi> Well; ſays St. <hi>John, the Word</hi> was <hi>a God,</hi> but then <hi>this God</hi> was <hi>but a Man,</hi> tho' he was the Son of God, the Prince of all Creatures, and the deſigned Lord of Men and Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:37508:11"/>
                  <hi>The Word was a God; and the Word was Fleſh.</hi> That is then as if the Evangeliſt had ſaid: <q>The <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> call <hi>the Word a God;</hi> ſo do I too; but at the ſame time I declare that <hi>the Word</hi> is ſuch <hi>a God</hi> as is but <hi>a Creature,</hi> and is no other but <hi>the Man Jeſus,</hi> who was God's only begotten Son, being born of a Virgin by the Power of God, and who was anointed with and conſtantly aſſiſted by the Holy Spirit. This is <hi>the Christ,</hi> and <hi>the God Word.</hi> Thoſe then are mere Fables, which the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and <hi>Cerinthians</hi> hold, of the <hi>Chriſt</hi> his being an I know not what <hi>uncreated Logos,</hi> and <hi>Divine Hypoſtaſis,</hi> proceeding out of the <hi>Bythos</hi> or <hi>Abyſs,</hi> and ordered by the Father to dwell in the Man <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>After all, it is not abſolutely certain, whether St. <hi>John</hi> wrote againſt <hi>Cerinthus.</hi> We have not ſo much as the Aſſertion of any one of the Ancients for it, before St. <hi>Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And tis no new thing for ſuch, to give but an indifferent and imperfect account of the Sentiments of thoſe that differ from 'em, and to raiſe Stories diſadvantageous to them, which good Men, ſuch as was <hi>Ireneus,</hi> took afterwards upon truſt. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, we ſee that St. <hi>John</hi> decares <hi>the Word</hi> to be <hi>the Man Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and in many Places of his Goſpel ſhews him to be a <hi>Creature.</hi> And, if <hi>Ireneus</hi> was well inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf and has informed us right, <hi>Cerinthus</hi> held this erroneous Opinion, that <hi>the Word</hi> is <hi>a real, eternal, Divine Perſon,</hi> and conſequently that there are <hi>more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons than one.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Ireneus</hi> his Party, moſt probably, found fault with <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> becauſe (beſides his Superſtition for the Law) he had not the ſame No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>the Word,</hi> that they had. <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> it ſeems, believed <hi>the Word</hi> to be a real Divine Perſon, equal to the Father, as the real <hi>Trinitarians</hi> do. And probably <hi>Ireneus</hi> was an <hi>Arian,</hi> or at moſt a <hi>Semi-Arian.</hi> What <hi>Grotius</hi> ſays of the Occaſion of St. <hi>John's</hi> writting this Goſpel, may be ſeen in his <hi>Annotations:</hi> The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> conſiſtently to their Syſtem, may hold all, that he there ſays of <hi>the Word.</hi>

As if <hi>the Baptiſt</hi> had ſaid. Tho', then, <hi>this Man,</hi> (as it is at the 30th. Verſe,) that cometh after me, enters upon his Office but when I have almoſt done mine; yet he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to an Higher Office and Dignity than mine, for he is my Superior, my Lord, and my Prince; he is the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Saviour of the World, a moſt Holy Man, the Son of God, the deſigned Sovereign of the Univerſe; and I am but his Servant and Harbinger.</p>
               <p>Whereas the <hi>Vulgate</hi> has tranſlated, <hi>This</hi> WAS <hi>he of whom I ſpake, Beza</hi> ſhews there is no reaſon but that it may be rendred, <hi>This</hi> IS <hi>he.</hi> In like manner, we need not read <hi>he</hi> WAS <hi>before me,</hi> but <hi>he</hi> IS.

               <p>THE <hi>Arians</hi> do not much diſlike the foregoing Expoſition, excepting that they are perſuaded it is ſhort as to theſe Particulars, in that the <hi>Socinians</hi> do not hold our Saviour's Soul to have prae-exiſted before its Conception, and, conſequently, do not admit it to have been an Inſtrument in the firſt Creation of the World: But the <hi>Arians</hi> maintain both theſe Points. It is true, ſay they, <hi>the Word,</hi> the Son of God by excellency, is a Creature, (tho' moſt intimately aſſiſted of God, which the <hi>Socinians</hi> do not deny;) Chriſt is a true Man, made up of a Body and Soul only, and not of an abſolutely eternal Hypoſtaſis alſo, or infinite Perſon, of the ſame numerical Eſſence with the Father: But then, ſay they, this Man's Soul was not only <hi>before Abraham,</hi> but even was the firſt Created Spirit. (<hi>John,</hi> 17.5.) For ſo the Scripture calls him expreſly <hi>the Firſt-born of every Creature,</hi> or <hi>the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Creation of God,</hi> and terms him by eminency <hi>the Image of the inviſible God; Col.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.14. &amp;c. Moreover it is aſſerted, that <hi>by him God made the Worlds; Heb.</hi> 1.2. And St. <hi>John</hi> ſays poſitively, that <hi>without him was not any thing made that was made; John,</hi> 1.3. Which expreſſions ſeem too extenſive, to be reſtrained to the New-Creation only. <hi>All things</hi> then <hi>were made by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>the Firſt-born of every Creature</hi> muſt be ſo tranſcendently Excellent, as incomparably farther to ſurpaſs originally all Men and Angels in Excellency of Nature, Wiſdom and Power, than they ſurpaſs the meaneſt of the Brute Beaſts. In a word, the <hi>Arians</hi> believe, that that Holy Spirit, whom the Scripture calls <hi>the Firſt-Born,</hi> (and who in proceſs of time was made the Soul of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi>) is originally as Perfect a Being, and as like unto God, as Divine and Almighty Power could produce, and as can poſſibly be imagined, ſalving the Unity of God; ſeeing it is ſaid he had a Part in the Creation of the World, in which God
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37508:12"/>moſt efficaciouſly aſſiſted him, and it is repreſented as the higheſt Liberality to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that God gave his Son to Redeem Men.

And they believe he was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Duration of Eternity, and before Time, that is to ſay, before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World. And in that ſenſe, like the <hi>Semi-Arians,</hi> they will not ſcruple to ſay, that <hi>the Firſt-born</hi> is <hi>Eternal,</hi> ſo it be remembred that he was made, and that he is not an uncreated Being, it being impoſſible there ſhould be two uncreated Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or two Gods in the proper ſenſe of the word: But <hi>the Firſt-born</hi> is a God next to God, and as Eternal as it is poſſible for the Excellenteſt Creature to be.</p>

                  </gap> ſo, it cannot be thought impoſſible, but that God might have endued the moſt excellent created Spirit with Power to Produce other Spirits. But perhaps Angels have fine Vehicles, which are Part of their Being, as a Human Body is Part of a Man. And then <hi>the Firſt-born</hi> might be aſſiſting in the preparing of theſe Vehicles, when God had Created the Subſtance thereof.</p>
               <p>When <hi>the Firſt-born</hi> was created, then was alſo another eminent Spirit (or other eminent Spirits, according to ſome Modern <hi>Arians</hi>) produced, but inferior to him, and called in Scripture <hi>the Holy Spirit.</hi> Thus far the <hi>Arians</hi> hold. It may be that by this (or theſe) laſt, not only an Archangel, (or the Archangels, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21.) but the whole Body of Angels, is to be underſtood; for they often ſeem to be meant, when the Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>the Holy Spirit:</hi> And, if ſo, they alſo were inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in the Creation of the World, as well as <hi>the Firſt-born,</hi> tho' not ſo eminently as he, but <hi>under him.</hi> Which doth not import, that the <hi>Angels</hi> or the <hi>First-born</hi> produced Creatures into being out of Nothing. But, the Chaos being created or prepared by Almighty God, then, for reaſons not perfectly known to us, God thought good to ſet <hi>the Firſt born,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Angels,</hi> in their ſeveral ſtations, to work upon it, and He directed and enabled them to concur with Him in the diſpoſing and ſetting of it into a regular frame and beautiful and convenient order. (It is now the conſtant courſe of Nature, that Creatures produce other Creatures. A like Power then, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably higher degree, might undoubtedly be given by God to incomparably more excellent Beings. It may be ſaid that by the Sun all things in the World live and grow, and that without him no living thing ſubſiſts or can ſubſiſt. And could God create no intelligent, ſpiritual and inviſible Beings, Superior to the Sun in Power and Vertue? Why ſhould we think the Material Sun to be God's <hi>Ne plus ultra,</hi> or his powerfuleſt and excellenteſt Creature poſſible?) Thus then the Holy Spirits of God, and, among the reſt and in the Chiefeſt Place, that Moſt Excellent Spirit which afterwards took Fleſh of the <hi>Virgin Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is certain that God alone might as eaſily have done all this, as with the concurrent Aſſiſtance of his Son, or Chief Miniſter, and of his Angels. But it may be He had a mind thereby to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37508:12"/>their Talents, and to try their Obedience, Aſſiduity, Diligence, and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his Service. Probably it adds to the Happineſs of vertuous and holy Spirits to be doing ſomthing in the ſervice of God. It is alſo poſſible God would cauſe them to have a hand in that Work, to endear the whole Creation to them, and them to all rational Creatures according to the natural Duties of Gratitude. What has coſt us ſome labor we commonly have a great affection for, witneſs the love of Mothers to their Children. It cannot then but be a great ſatisfaction to the Holy Spirits to look upon Men as in ſome meaſure their Production as well as their Pupils. That will naturally give them an extraordinary tenderneſs for Mankind. Now there is a Pleaſure in Love, and in doing good. And that the Holy Angels might not want that rational, ſolid and durable Pleaſure, God, according to this Syſtem, thought good to employ them in his Works. It is then no Argument that God could not employ them therein, becauſe He is himſelf All-ſufficient thereto, being Almighty. Tho' God can eaſily do all things alone, and is properly the only Creator, yet we daily ſee that He makes uſe of Inſtruments, or Means and Second Cauſes. We have then no reaſon to ſtagger at that aſſertion of the Scripture, that by and with that Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> God had made the World or drawn Order out of the Chaos, and diſpos'd all the Parts of the Univerſe in their due Places and Frame.</p>
               <p>Tho' that Holy Spirit was the Firſt born of every Creature and a moſt excellent Image of God, yet, immediatly after that he was produced, before the being of Time or the Production of Angels and of the Material Creation, it may be that God created many more Spirits of almoſt a like Kind and Dignity, or incomparably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Angelical Nature, and that the Soul of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> had then no Superiority beſides that of Order over them, but theſe were in a manner or in other reſpects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, ſubject only to God, and equally Superior to the Holy Angels, an equal number of the Angels and inferior Spirits being put, when created as they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, under thoſe principal Lords, or Gods according to the Scripture-ſtile. But when the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> was become Man, and eſpecially after He had ſhed his Blood upon the Croſs and was riſen from the Dead and aſcended again into Heaven, then He was made the Prince and Sovereign, under Almighty God, of all Archangels, as well as of all Angels and of all other Creatures. It ſeems neceſſary to ſuppoſe that then began his Superiority over all the ſublimeſt Angels and all Creatures, becauſe the Scripture repreſents that as the Reward of his Obedience, and of the conſtant and faithful Performance of his Undertaking. So that if there were no created Spirits of almoſt the like Excellency with him, yet, from the very beginning that there were Angels, there might be many Archangels, which were not wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to him, tho' of a nature very much inferior to his, but had, like him, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate acceſs to God, and were then accountable to God alone, altho' at the firſt, at their Creation, God had left it to <hi>the Firſt-born</hi> to appoint to each of them their Office and Station. Perhaps the <hi>Socinian</hi> Expoſition is here to take place, as to the Creation of Dominions and Powers by our Lord <hi>Jeſus Christ:</hi> and the Firſt-born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited not the Dominion till after the Performance of his Undertaking for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And perhaps the Eternal Continuation of Glory, was the Reward propoſed to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:37508:13"/>Theſe things may exactly be ſome of theſe ways, for ought any body knows. And there is no reaſon to look upon the <hi>Arian</hi> Syſtem as incredible, upon the account that during the Agony which our Bleſſed Saviour underwent, a little before his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, an Angel was ſent to ſtrengthen him. Creatures may ſometime need to be put in mind of thoſe things which they already know. We daily ſee that good Men are much comforted and edified by the Exhortations of other Men like themſelves, and ſomtimes inferior to themſelves. Our Saviour was become a Man, and was then under ſuch ſtreights as are moſt dreadful to Human Nature. He wanted therefore external Aſſiſtances, the Powers of his Spirit being depreſſed to the Meaſure of a Human Soul at its Incarnation. But it was afterwards raiſed above its former Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, being exalted to Sir at the right hand of God.</p>
               <p>The firſt Verſes of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, and the other Texts relating to our Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> are very eaſy and intelligible, being taken in a Senſe agreable to this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem. But as to the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> it may be the Scripture means <hi>chiefly</hi> thereby the <hi>Holy Inſpiration</hi> and an Influence of the Power of God.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE <hi>Trinitarians</hi> urge, that all the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Expoſitions</hi> may in general, and all at once, be confuted by this one conſideration; That theirs is the old, prevailing Sentiment. To evince which, beſides the Writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſince the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and ſome Paſſages out of the <hi>Ante-nicene,</hi> they quote <hi>Pliny's</hi> Letter to <hi>Trajan,</hi> wherein he acquaints him that Chriſtians Sang Hymns to Chriſt as to a God, and <hi>Lucian's Philopatris,</hi> where mention is made of the God of Chriſtians his being one in three and three in one. Now, ſay the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> it hereby appears that ours is the Primitive Doctrin, and that 'tis moſt credible it is agreeable to the true ſenſe of Scripture, it being the general Sentiment of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors in the following Ages.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>further</hi> to evince the <hi>Antiquity, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> and <hi>Credibility</hi> of the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Doctrin, ſome add; that the ancient <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Heathens</hi> have believed a <hi>Trinity in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity:</hi> to which purpoſe they quote <hi>Plato, Philo</hi>'s Works, the <hi>Cabbala,</hi> or Tradition, delivered from Father to Son ſince the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the <hi>Chaldaïck Paraphraſe,</hi> wherein <hi>the Word of God</hi> ſeems to be repreſented as a <hi>Perſon.</hi> To all this the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> anſwer, in the following Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) The <hi>Jews</hi> have never held the Doctrin of three Perſons in God: And as for the Authority of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> it cannot much credit the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Cauſe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:37508:13"/>(2.) The Paſſages, in <hi>Pliny's</hi> Letter, and in the Dialogue entituled <hi>Philopatris,</hi> are inconteſtably invalid Arguments.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) No very conſiderable Argument can be drawn out of the <hi>Ante-nicene</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, becauſe they were but few that wrote, and it was not impoſſible for them to deviate from the Simplicity of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) Many excellent Works of the Primitive Writers have been ſuppreſſed and deſtroyed, which were moſt expreſs for the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Sentiment.</p>
               <p n="5">(5.) Of the few remaining Writings, that are aſcribed to the Fathers of the firſt three Centuries, 'tis very credible that ſome are corrupted and ſome ſuppoſititious.</p>
               <p n="6">(6.) Howbeit, it ſtill in a great meaſure appears, that the generality of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians were <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> and even that the generality of the remaining Authors of the firſt three Centuries were far enough from being of that Opinion which now is called Orthodox, it being evident that they incline more to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> than to the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Sentiment of the latter Ages.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) The prevailing Sentiment of the following Ages is of no weight againſt the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">(8.) The Prevalency in general of an Opinion is no Argument, that it is agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Truth and acceptable to God.</p>
               <p n="9">(9.) The only Authority therefore, that we can and ought to rely upon, is that of the Bible.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>The Jews have never held the Doctrin of three Perſons in God: and as for the Authority of the Heathens, it cannot much credit the</hi> Trinitarian <hi>Cauſe.</hi> The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> readily grant the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Sentiment to be <hi>Heatheniſh,</hi> ſeeing it effectually ſets up a Plurality of Gods, or ſeveral ſupremely and really Divine Perſons: And they think it very probable that at firſt ſome Chriſtians took this Doctrin out of <hi>Plato</hi>'s School, whoſe Philoſophy was generally ſtudied and admired, tho' perhaps the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal meaning of it as to this Point was little underſtood or conſidered by the generality of his Diſciples. For there is much reaſon to believe that <hi>Plato,</hi> and thoſe of the ſame Sentiment with him, who believed but one God, at firſt <hi>perſonalized</hi> the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or chief <hi>Attributes of the Deity,</hi> to <hi>accommodate</hi> themſelves to the Theology of the <hi>Heathens,</hi> to hide and take off the Odium of their own Notions of the Divine <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> which otherwiſe would have been looked upon as <hi>next to Atheiſm,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would ſeem to hold more <hi>Divine Perſons</hi> or more <hi>Gods</hi> than one, it being reckoned eſſential to Religion to own a <hi>Plurality</hi> of Gods: Theſe Philoſophers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo reaſoned about the Divine Attributes, as if they really held ſeveral diſtinct Gods. Indeed 'tis very credible, that many of 'em afterwards were induced to Error by thoſe Expreſſions, and Philoſophized ſo high about them that they loſt themſelves and underſtood not what they ſaid. But as for <hi>Plato,</hi> 'tis very likely that he meant by his ſeveral <hi>Perſons</hi> but the ſeveral <hi>Attributes</hi> of the ſame Divine Being; only he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to vail his Sentiment, for fear of expoſing himſelf to <hi>Socrates</hi> his fate, having no mind to ſuffer for his Opinion. This appears in his Letters to <hi>Dyoniſius,</hi> wherein he tells him; <q>It is difficult to find out the Father of the Univerſe, and when you have found him it is not lawful to divulge it to the People.—I ſhall then ſpeak of this ſubject enigmatically, that every one may not be able to underſtand me.</q> He ſets up therefore a <hi>Trinity</hi> above all other Gods or Angels, and; as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37508:14"/>from his Cautiouſneſs, from his Sentiment and that of <hi>Socrates</hi> of one God, and from the Current of his Expreſſions, by this <hi>Trinity</hi> he underſtood infinite <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> infinite <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and infinite <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Power;</hi> but, to wrap up his Doctrin under myſterious terms, he repreſents this <hi>Trinity</hi> as being three Divine <hi>Hypoſtaſes</hi> or <hi>Perſons:</hi> He ſays, the firſt is the Origin of the other two; <hi>the Good Being</hi> or the firſt Principle is the Father of the <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and made and produced, (and, ſo, it might be conſidered by ſome as a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God, and the Firſt-born of <hi>the Good Being;</hi>) and the <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> is the third moſt excellent God, and the ſecond Production of <hi>the Good.</hi> This Theology, moſt obſcurely expreſsed, <hi>Plato</hi>'s Followers have explained according to their own Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, till they made it by their Explications ſtill more obſcure and more unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible. But of what <hi>Authority</hi> are theſe <hi>Philoſophical Fancies</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſh Myſteries?</hi> Tho' it ſeem to ſome that they may be accomodated to ſome Expreſſions in Scripture, yet there is no reaſon to interpret Scripture by that fanciful and fantanſtical Rule, as is well obſerved by <hi>Beza,</hi> who calls thoſe Philoſophical Conceits <hi>Platonica Deliria,</hi> in his <hi>Annotations</hi> on <hi>John,</hi> 1.1. Whether or no ſome Heathen Sages before <hi>Plato,</hi> may then have had the like thoughts and deſign with him, ſo that he was in ſome meaſure but an imitator of them; what is that alſo to Chriſtians? What if <hi>Parme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides</hi> had learned of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras</hi> of <hi>Pherecides,</hi> the Notion of three Hypoſtaſes, ſo that the accommodation of Polytheiſm to a diſſembled Unitarianiſm was perhaps older than <hi>Plato</hi> by an Age or two? And what if the Authors of this Theology, whoever they were, took theſe Hypoſtaſes to be real Deities? Ought ſuch an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſs to be of any weight with Us? And can we make it a Queſtion, Which is the beſt; either to regard theſe <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> Philoſophical <hi>Whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> or to be guided by the <hi>clear</hi> Light of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and the moſt <hi>expreſs</hi> Texts of <hi>Scripture?</hi> After all, the <hi>Platonick</hi> Cant is ſo obſcure, that, for ought that can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the contrary, all that <hi>Platoniſm</hi> implies of a <hi>Trinity,</hi> may amount to no more than <hi>Semi-Arianiſm</hi> or even <hi>Arianiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>the Opinion of the Jews.</hi> Tho' it be certain that the People of God were <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> yet it is not impoſſible but that a <hi>few</hi> of their Metaphyſick Wits might <hi>Philoſophize</hi> after the way of <hi>Heathen,</hi> and be infatuated with <hi>Plato,</hi> and conceive, as well as many Chriſtians, that thoſe ſtrange and admired Speculations might agree with Scripture, and be reconciled with the Doctrin of the Unity of God. But of what conſequence is the Particular Fancy of three or four Viſionaries to the whole <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Jews?</hi> Becauſe theſe wanderers ſtrayed aſide from the Simplicity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and preferred the arbitrary Notions of a <hi>vain Philoſophy</hi> before it; doth it follow that the generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> were <hi>Platoniſts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Philo, Euſebius</hi> conjectures, and <hi>Photius</hi> expreſly affirms, that he was a Chriſtian; if ſo, it muſt be a <hi>Platonick Chriſtian,</hi> or kind of <hi>Semi-Arian.</hi> Some then have thought it not impoſſible but that this <hi>Philo,</hi> whoſe Works we have, is not he who went on the Embaſſage to <hi>Caligula,</hi> but is another <hi>Philo</hi> of the Second Century: Neither do they think it impoſſible but that the Monks may have very much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted his Writings. Indeed it ſeems improbable that a <hi>Jew</hi> ſhould have written all that is attributed to <hi>Philo.</hi> Howbeit, it ſuffices that he was a <hi>Platonist,</hi> and had a great many extravagant Notions. See Mr. <hi>Nye</hi>'s Second Letter to a Peer, <hi>p.</hi> 66. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:37508:14"/>After all, the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> as was obſerved, are very obſcure. And ſome contend, that all that <hi>Philo</hi> ſays of a <hi>Trinity,</hi> amounts not above <hi>Arianiſm.</hi> See <hi>Sandi. Hist. Eccl. enucl. Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Secul.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>But what do we ſay of the <hi>Cabbala,</hi> or Traditionary Knowledg delivered from Father to Son ſince the time of <hi>Moſes?</hi> Why, in good earneſt; what can we ſay of it, but that it is a Chimera, a rabinnical Legend, a phariſaïcal Device, to deceive the People, and make every thing paſs as Sacred that the Doctors pleaſe. All Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants look upon <hi>Tradition,</hi> as a moſt unſafe and uncertain Means of tranſmitting from Age to Age Divine Truths, and as no fixed Rule of Religion. And we ſee Our Saviour never mentions the <hi>Jewiſh Tradition</hi> but to oppoſe it. After all, it can never be ſhewn that the <hi>Cabbala</hi> aſſerts a <hi>Trinity of Perſons in God.</hi> Ever ſince that Doctrin has been broached, the generality of the <hi>Jews</hi> have expreſſed the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe they have taken at it, and have made it an Objection againſt Chriſtians. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> ſays, that, tho' he had often diſputed with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rabbins that were of moſt eſteem, he never ſaw any of them approve this Doctrin, that the Word is God, or a God, (in the <hi>Platonick</hi> or <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Senſe.) And he aſſerts, that it is not the Opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> whom they expect, is to be a God, or a Divin Perſon, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is to be a meer Man, and an Earthly King. <hi>Con.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Senſe all the Places, where the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſts mention <hi>the Word of God.</hi> Probably they thereby commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, in ſpeaking of God, the Wiſdom of God attended and ſet forth with Command and Authority in acting, which Word or Authority God ſomtimes communicates in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manners or meaſures to ſome Creatures: And therefore ſomtimes by <hi>the Word of God,</hi> they underſtand a Creature; for inſtance, at the 1ſt. Verſe of the 110th. <hi>Pſalm</hi> they give that Name to <hi>Solomon,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Kings of Iſrael</hi> were <hi>God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties;</hi> and perhaps they interpreted that Verſe, like ſome other Places, of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,</hi> to whom it is applicable, and who, as they expected, was to be a Temporal <hi>King</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>David.</hi> No reaſon can be aſſigned, why they could not give <hi>that.</hi> Title in that ſenſe to the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> (holding him only as a Creature) tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they gave it to ſome of God's Attributes. Dr. <hi>Allix</hi> fancies that <hi>Philo</hi> actually <hi>perſonalized</hi> one of the Divin Attributes, namely, the Divin Wiſdom, whom he called <hi>the Word of God.</hi> Yet, as we have before remark'd, the Dr. himſelf obſerv'd, that <hi>Philo</hi> calls alſo <hi>Angels</hi> in the Plural <hi>the Words of God.</hi> (<hi>Philo. De Migrat. Abrah.</hi> p. 415.) The ſame Title then may be given, both, to God, (or ſome Divin Influence or Divin Virtue,) and to ſome Creatures, who act for God, and who peculiarly repreſent him, and in and by whom he extraordinarily manifeſts his Wiſdom and Authority. What belongs to God may be accomodated, or figurativly attributed, to ſuch Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rures. And it is inconteſtable, that by <hi>the Word,</hi> in ſpeaking of God, and by <hi>the Divin Spirit,</hi> or the Breath of his Mouth, may be meant the <hi>Actings</hi> or moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Manifeſtations of his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for ſuch expreſſions as theſe in the Old Teſtament, <hi>O God I have waited for thy Salvation,</hi> when they are accommodated to the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> or the times of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> they may import no more than this, <q>O God I have waited for thy Succor, or the Deliverance of thy People from the Power of their Enemies, by the means of thy Victorious Meſſenger, the Great <hi>King of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </q> Howbeit, the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> acting for God and being a King, might be called <hi>God,</hi> as well as <hi>Solomon, Pſ.</hi> 45. and with much greater reaſon.</p>
               <p>We cannot better conclude this Article than with two Obſervations in Dr. <hi>Bull</hi>'s Book, <hi>Judicium Eccleſiae.</hi> In the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, it was a great Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy between ſome <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and the <hi>Jews;</hi> whether the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> according to the deſcriptions given of him in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> is to be <hi>God,</hi> or a <hi>Man</hi> only? Thoſe <hi>Chriſtians</hi> believed, He is repreſented in the Old Teſtament, as <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>a God;</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>a mere Man. Judic. Eccl.</hi> p. 15, 16. And at p. 21. the Dr. adds, Our Saviour puts this Queſtion to the <hi>Phariſees; Whoſe Son is Chriſt?</hi> They anſwered, ſays the Text, <hi>the Son of David.</hi> But if Chriſt, <hi>ſays our Saviour again,</hi> is the Son of <hi>David;</hi> why then doth <hi>David</hi> call him <hi>Lord?</hi> The <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> remarks hereupon; <hi>they were not able to anſwer him a word.</hi> But had they known any thing of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the Solution of the propoſed Difficulty had been moſt eaſy and obvious to 'em. We may then conclude, the <hi>Jews</hi> believed only that the Chriſt was to be <hi>a Great King in this World,</hi> but not a Great King in the next, and much leſs did they imagin He ſhould be God in a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Senſe than <hi>this,</hi> whether in the <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Tritheiſtick</hi> Senſe. So that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37508:15"/>of the <hi>Jews</hi> were as certainly <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> as the Generality of the Heathens were <hi>Polytheiſts.</hi> And as for the Conceits of the objected Philoſophers, we have ſeen that their Speculations are of as little Importance and Authority, as they are myſterious and uncertain, obſcure and unintelligible.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>The Paſſages, in Pliny's Letter, and in the Dialogue intituled Philopatris, are inconteſtably invalid Arguments.</hi> The Paſſage in <hi>Pliny's</hi> Letter, ſo much objected to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> is, that, he ſays, Chriſtians, in their Meetings, <hi>Sang Hymns to Chriſt, ut Deo, as being a God.</hi> To this the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> give the following anſwers. Firſt; it is probable that Paſſage is corrupted, and inſtead of <hi>ut Deo</hi> we ſhould read <hi>et Deo;</hi> for ſo it was in the Copies in <hi>Tertullian's</hi> time. <hi>Tertul. Apol. adv. Gentes. C.</hi> 3. And then the Meaning being that Chriſtians <hi>Sang Hymns to Chriſt</hi> AND <hi>to God,</hi> that is ſo far from implying that they held Chriſt to be God Almighty himſelf, that it ſhews the contrary, Chriſt being there diſtinguiſhed from God. And his being joyned with God, in Hymns Sang to both their Praiſe, argues no more his being God himſelf, than it would argue that <hi>Jael</hi> is God, becauſe ſhe is bleſſed as well as God in the ſame Pſalm of Praiſe. <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Praiſe ye the Lord for the avenging of Iſrael.</hi> And at the 24th. Verſe, <hi>Bleſſed above Women ſhall Jael be. Deborah</hi> alſo her ſelf, the Compoſer of this Hymn, and <hi>Barack, the Governors of Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>the Princes of Iſſachar</hi> are praiſed at the 7th. 9th. 12th. and 15th. Verſes. Thus in the 5th. Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Men and Angels are repreſented Singing Hymns both to God and Chriſt, ſaying, <q>Bleſſing, Honor, Glory, and Power, be unto Him that ſiteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever. Worthy is the Lamb, that was Slain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdom, and Strength, and Honor and Glory, and Bleſſing. And the four and twenty Elders ſaid, Worthy is the Lamb, for he was Slain, and has redeemed us to God by his Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Which, by the way it may be obſerved, ſhews what inconteſtably Chriſtians ought to do, <hi>viz.</hi> (tho' not to addreſs direct and ultimate Prayers, yet) to Sing Hymns, in Honor, to Chriſt; which may be lookt upon as the true Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Pſ.</hi> 72.15. (ſpiritually accommodated to Chriſt,) beſides that there is no doubt but that the Angels and the Holy Spirits in Heaven may daily preſent Requeſts and Petitions to Chriſt, concerning particular Men and Churches; and when Chriſt is ſeen, he is to be addreſſed unto by Men, as their Saviour, and their Sovereign un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God. Moreover, the generality of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> ever held, that Chriſt is to be Worſhipped, and Prayed to, as the Mediator of the New-Covenant, and the Vicegerent of the Univerſe, conſtantly aſſiſted with the Divin Wiſdom and Power, to the Glory of the Father, according to God's appointment.</p>
               <p>Secondly; reading <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t Deo,</hi> that may ſignify, either <hi>as being God,</hi> or <hi>as being a God,</hi> and <hi>as if he were God,</hi> that is, <hi>were held God,</hi> or <hi>a God.</hi> If the former; that might be <hi>Pliny's</hi> own miſtaken Conjecture, that becauſe he underſtood Chriſtians Sang Chriſt's Praiſes, he therefore imagin'd they took him for the Supreme God. But indeed 'tis moſt unlikely that this was <hi>Pliny's</hi> Meaning; for, being uſed himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Heathen Rites to Sing Hymns to others beſides the Supreme God or (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd) Supreme Gods, it ſeems he could not upon this account conclude that Chriſtians believed Chriſt to be God Almighty himſelf. It ſeems therefore he could only mean, that Chriſtians Sang Hymns in Praiſe of Chriſt, <hi>as believing him to be</hi> A GOD. By
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37508:16"/>which Phraſe the Heathens themſelves knew 'twas not neceſſary to underſtand the Supreme God. For as the Scripture calls ſome Creatures <hi>Gods,</hi> ſo the Heathens, tho' groundleſly, yet, often, gave that Title to ſeveral whom they knew and owned to be Created Beings. And in Chap. 2d. we have ſeen that Chriſtians in thoſe times made no difficulty to do the like, where (whether now right or wrong is another Queſtion) they thought they had warrant from Scripture to give that Appellation to ſome glorified Creatures; and therefore there is no doubt but that, ſince many of them gave it to <hi>Angels</hi> in an inferior Senſe, they much more gave it to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Sovereign</hi> of all Angels as well as Men, tho' they believed him to be but <hi>ſuch</hi> a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified Creature.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Pliny's</hi> Meaning was, as 'tis not impoſſible but that the Expreſſion may import, that Chriſtians Sang to Chriſt, <hi>as if he were held God, or a God;</hi> that is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to what <hi>Trinitarians</hi> would have him to atteſt. For then 'tis as if he had ſaid, that Chriſtians Sang to Chriſt, <hi>as if they had believed him to be God, or a God, which yet, according to this, it ſhould ſeem, they believed not.</hi> But moſt probably not this, but the foregoing, was <hi>Pliny's</hi> Senſe, if we muſt read <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T Deo,</hi> namely, <hi>as to a God,</hi> or <hi>as to one whom they held for a God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Dialogue intituled <hi>Philopatris,</hi> wherein mention is made of the God who is <hi>Three and One, One and Three;</hi> the beſt Criticks own it not to be a Dialogue of <hi>Lucian's,</hi> as the Tranſlators themſelves obſerve. We have many inſtances of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Treatiſes, joyned, either by chance or out of deſign, to ſome Authors Works, that yet belong not to that Author. It may then very well be, that that Dialogue is much later than <hi>Lucian.</hi> But if it were <hi>Lucian's,</hi> what could the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> infer from thence, but that there were then ſome Chriſtians that believed a <hi>Platonick Trinity,</hi> and that <hi>Lucian</hi> was acquainted with ſome of them, or had confuſedly heard of that ſtrange Doctrin, and took occaſion to mention it? Yet the original Meaning of that Myſtery might be, that Chriſtians looked on the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> as Divine or moſt <hi>Sublime</hi> Perſons next to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> or <hi>as one</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> being of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or of the like Affections with Him, and being, together with Him, above all Angels as well as above all Men, whereby, however, was conſtituted but one Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Government, the Holy Scripture owning properly but one God, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians ſo underſtanding it. Howbeit, tis reckoned that <hi>Lucian</hi> flouriſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of the Second Century. And the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> own, that <hi>the Evangelical Doctrin concerning the Divin <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity was then begun to be corrupted.</hi> On the other hand, <hi>Trinitarians will not, cannot, deny,</hi> but that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm was profeſſed at leaſt by many Chriſtians from the beginning of Chriſtianity.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Plea of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> appears vain, unleſs it could be ſhewn that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Doctrin was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of in the earlieſt times of the Church, and was not the Sentiment of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles themſelves.</p>

               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>NO very conſiderable Argument can be drawn out of the Antenicens Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, becauſe they were but few that wrote, and it was not impoſſible for them to deviate from the Simplicity of the Goſpel.</hi> Therefore certainly it is a prepoſterous Way, to ſeek to be tried by the Writings of the Fathers. Good Chriſtians, as <hi>Origen</hi> obſerves, <hi>(Pref. Operis contra Cels.)</hi> reckoned, in thoſe Primitive times, that Chriſtianity was better taught and defended by an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and exemplary Life, than by a multitude of Writings. Which ſhews, that they eſteemed the eſſence of Chriſtian Religion to conſiſt, not in abſtruſe Notions, or ſtrange Myſteries, and many Points of Speculation, but in plain Doctrines, (few in number, eaſy to be remembred, if Men would have been content with them, and worthy of all acceptation,) and in natural Precepts, agreable to right Reaſon, approved to every Mans Conſcience, and but a new Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript and Confirmation of the Light of Nature. They were perſuaded, that Sincere Repentance, according to the tenor of the Goſpel, and Holy Living and the Habitual Practice of Vertue, proceeding from a Principle of Faith that God is, and that thro' Chriſt He will reward them that diligently ſeek him, and will render to all Men according to their Deeds, was the Way to Heaven and the Sum of Chriſtianity. They thought it not neceſſary therefore to write many Books, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Chriſtianity but as Natural Religion revived and confirmed by Chriſt, or by God in and by the Miniſtry of Chriſt, with the addition only of the two Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Praying to God in the Name of Chriſt, as our Mediator and Interceſſor, the Procurer and Chief Miniſter of the Covenant of Reconciliation, the Head of the Church, the Saviour of Men, and the Governor of the World, to whom all Power was given for the Adminiſtration of the Univerſe under God, and who is conſtantly aſſiſted by the Spirit of God, which he has the priviledge to communicate to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as it is ſufficiently declared in the Writings of the New Teſtament. Chriſtian Religion, thus conceived and underſtood, is ſoon taught and learnt, and therefore needs not many Gloſſes and Comments, according to the Oracle in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> 31.34. And it ſeems the generality of the Primitive Chriſtians had this Idea of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity as may be ſhewn by the Relicks we have of them, or even by the Writings of their Succeſſors tho' thoſe went farther.

Theſe were not like to become Innovators. They ſtudied only how to acquit themſelves of their Duty, and prepare for Martyrdom, to which they were daily expoſed. But when <hi>Learned and Fanciful</hi> Men embraced Chriſtianity, eſpecially thoſe who had been Diſciples to the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers,</hi> they ſoon looked for <hi>new Myſteries</hi> in the Goſpel, and ſuppoſed they made great Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries therein by the means of their <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> which they always had in great eſteem. They accomodated therefore as much they could the Expreſſions of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their <hi>Philoſophical Syſtems.</hi> And thus <hi>the Myſteries of the Platonick Trinity,</hi> were by degrees <hi>introduced</hi> among <hi>Philoſophizing Chriſtians.</hi> Theſe are not bare Conjectures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dalaeus,</hi> in the 1ſt. Chapter of his 1ſt.

                  <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſaid, <hi>that the Opinions of Plato are not remote from thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And the ſame was affirmed by <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, Tertullian,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Platonick</hi> Fathers, who expounded the beginning of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel by <hi>Plato</hi>'s moſt obſcure Notions of his <hi>Logos</hi> or Second God.

               <p>Men that were ſuch admirers of the <hi>Heatheniſh Philoſophy,</hi> were eaſily <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to think that St. <hi>John</hi>'s Meaning was much the ſame with their <hi>Philoſopher</hi>'s Sentiment, when they perceived ſome <hi>Likeneſs</hi> between their Terms. It is not at all ſtrange therefore, if they <hi>introduced</hi> ſome change in the Chriſtian Doctrin, eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that their Interpretations ſeemed to make for the Glory of Chriſt and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Chriſtianity, which without doubt in its native Simplicity appeared to <hi>Pagans</hi> to be <hi>too mean,</hi> and too much deſtitute of <hi>Sublime Myſteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Circumſtances leſs favourable for Novelty than theſe, Alterations are ſoon made in Religion; witneſs the ſpeedy Corruption of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who, after a few days that <hi>Moſes</hi> had been abſent from them, and they being ſtill under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Brother <hi>Aaron,</hi> fell to <hi>Idolatry.</hi> Thus, as <hi>Hegeſippus</hi> teſtifies, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were no ſooner departed, but manifold Errors mightily ſpread.

               <p>What a weak thing then is it for the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> to ſtop their ears to the Dictates of <hi>Right Reaſon</hi> and to ſeveral Texts of <hi>Scripture</hi> which are <hi>expreſs</hi> againſt them, and to pretend that we ought to be determined by <hi>the fanciful Writings of a few fallible Men,</hi> moſt of whom came ſome conſiderable while after the Deceaſe of the Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>The Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſince the Reformation, has had ſeveral Learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and in theſe late times eſpecially. If any of their Works remain a thouſand
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37508:17"/>Years hence, we may (humanly) ſuppoſe, in caſe the Doctrines therein contain'd continue to be liked, it will be the Writings of <hi>Pearſon, Stillingfleet, Cudworth, Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotſon, Burnet, Scot, Cave, Towerſon,</hi> and ſome <hi>few</hi> others of the like kind. But what ſhould we think of our Poſterity, if they then pretended that the way to find out the Original Meaning of our Articles concerning Predeſtination and Free Will, would be to interpret them by the Sentiments laid down and eſtabliſhed or intimated in moſt of theſe Great Men's Books?</p>
               <p>Thus we have obſerved, that in the firſt three Centuries not only <hi>few</hi> Chriſtians wrote in compariſon of what they have done ſince, but it was not impoſſible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for them conſiderably to <hi>alter</hi> the Primitive Sentiments or the Doctrin of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>Many excellent Works of the Primitive Writers have been ſuppreſſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, which were most expreſs for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Sentiment.</hi> The <hi>Trinitarians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>regret</hi> many of <hi>thoſe Writings</hi> of the Primitive Chriſtians of the firſt three Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, which <hi>appear</hi> to have been <hi>ſuppreſſed</hi> and <hi>deſtroyed.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian.</hi> But it may be obſerved, that <hi>Euſebius,</hi> tho' he profeſſed the <hi>Nicone Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſm,</hi> was a <hi>Semi-Arian,</hi> and favoured the <hi>Arians;</hi> and perhaps he thought good to excuſe <hi>Hegeſippus,</hi> notwithſtanding what he himſelf profeſſed, as ſeveral learned Men in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> defend <hi>Janſenius,</hi> at the ſame time that they openly abjure <hi>Janſeniſm.</hi>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37508:18"/>been foiſted therein, which the <hi>Semi-Arian</hi> Fathers did afterwards openly maintain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Yet ſome contend that thoſe Writings expreſly contain the ſame Doctrin that was originally Apoſtolical, and afterwards defended by <hi>Arius</hi> when it had been diſguis'd by the <hi>Platoniſts.</hi> Howbeit, it is certain thoſe that had either particular Opinions of their own, or particular intereſts to ſerve, made often no ſcruple to forge ſome Writings favouring them, which, in order to gain them the more credit, they aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome Great Men. Several Apocryphal Books were put out under the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles's Names. How much more then, ſays <hi>Dalaeus,</hi> would they make bold with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Nay, he obſerves that the Fathers themſelves have been guilty of ſuch Frauds. See the third Chap. of his firſt Book <hi>De uſu Patrum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And you need but read his following Chapter, to ſee that the genuine Writings of the Fathers have been corrupted. St. <hi>Jerom</hi> complains of the Impudence of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in corrupting of Books. (<hi>Ep.</hi> 28. <hi>ad Lucin.</hi> T. 1. p. 247.) And yet he owns, that himſelf, in tranſlating <hi>Origen,</hi> omitted what was noxious or dangerous, that is, what ſuited not to his own Sentiments, and ſays that St. <hi>Hilary</hi> and others did the like. You may ſee the Quotations, and many more Allegations to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, in that Chapter of <hi>Dalaeus,</hi> where he quotes <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Saying, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks ſcrupled not to correct or put out ſome things in the Scripture it ſelf, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uſe that the Hereticks might make of thoſe Paſſages. <hi>Dalaeus</hi> determines not whether <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſpake true or not herein, but he infers from thence that thoſe ancient Catholicks would have made no difficulty, to correct in like manner as much as they could the Writings of the Primitive Fathers, where they widely differ'd from the Sentiments that had prevailed, and where thoſe that were reckoned Hereticks might have found too undeniable Authorities for their Opinions. After this, can thoſe be blamed, who will be determined by nothing but the Current of <hi>Scripture</hi> and the moſt inconteſtable Axioms of <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such Catholicks as <hi>Dalaeus</hi> repreſents to us, we may think, made no great ſcrupſe to invent Stories that might favour them, or to give eaſily credit to ſuch tho' upon the weakeſt Grounds, and to uſe ſuch like ſhifts to defend what they took for Truth; Witneſs the Book of <hi>Hermas,</hi> and what <hi>Jerom</hi> owns of himſelf, and of the freedom he thought in ſuch caſes lawful to take. <q>A Man, ſays he, argues as he pleaſes. He may make a ſhew of preſenting you with Bread, as ſays the Proverb, and all the while he may hold nothing but a Stone. He may ſay one thing, and think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Conſider the Arguments made uſe of by <hi>Origenes, Methodius, Euſebius, Appollinaris.</hi> They are often forced to alledge many things, which they did not believe, but which were neceſſary to ſupport their Sentiments. I ſay nothing of the <hi>Latin</hi> Authors, <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Minucius, Victorinus, Lactantius, Hilary,</hi> leſt I ſhould ſeem to accuſe others rather than defend my ſelf. (<hi>Ep.</hi> 50. <hi>ad Pamm. T.</hi> 2. p. 136.) When I write my Books, ſays he, I call for my Copiſt or Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuenſis, and I often dictate the thoughts of others that I have read, tho' I don't believe 'em my ſelf, and ſometime don't very well remember their Senſe.

               <p>
                  <hi>Dalaeus,</hi> towards the beginning of the fourth Chap. of his ſaid Book, ſeems to intimate, that we have nothing much to be relied on but the Holy Scripture; which, ſays he, has always been preſerved with much greater care than other Writings; which all Nations have learned; which all Languages have tranſlated; and which all Sects have retained, the Hereticks as well as the Orthodox, the Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks as well as the Catholicks, the Greeks and Latins, Muſcovites and Aethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>We may then conclude this Article, with this Reflection: It is altogether incredible that the Scripture has been materially corrupted; but it is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Writings of the Doctors may have been conſiderably changed and altered.</p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> and to thoſe Churches and Parties that retained the Primitive Doctrin of the Goſpel. They, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, (and that was the leaſt harm they did them) called them by ſeveral Nick-names, as <hi>Nazarens, Ebionites, Mineans, Alogi,</hi> and the like.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> had begun in the Apoſtles's time to call the Chriſtians, that were among them, <hi>Nazarens,</hi> and <hi>Mineans,</hi> (which laſt ſignifies <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and the other is a Denomination from Our Saviour whom the Unbelievers in deriſion call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>the Nazarene</hi>) as it appears, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.5. and 14. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> (and moſt ancient) Chriſtians were alſo, as ſome think, called afterwards, by the Platoniſts, <hi>Ebionites,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>the Poor,</hi> either, as ſome pretend, from a Man named <hi>Ebion</hi> who (they ſay) was a great Denfender of them, or becauſe they were the ordinary and <hi>poorer</hi> ſort of People who preſerved the longeſt the Primitive Doctrin and could the moſt hardly be brought to reliſh the Notions of Platoniſm, or, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> aſſerts, becauſe the Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts accuſed them to have but <hi>poor</hi> and low Opinions of Chriſt. In fine, among the <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts, the Maintainers of the Primitive Doctrine were, by ſome, called <hi>Alogi</hi> or <hi>Alogians,</hi> as if they believed not Chriſt to be the <hi>Logos</hi> or the Word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believed not an eternal Word like <hi>Plato;</hi> and it is ſaid, that ſome of theſe <hi>Gentile</hi> Chriſtians received not at firſt the Goſpel of St. <hi>John,</hi> as the generality of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians admited not preſently ſome other Books of the New Teſtament, particularly St. <hi>John's Revelation,</hi> and the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> which generally for 400 Years was not received as Canonical. It is too uſual to go from one extream to another; and it may be therefore that ſome of thoſe <hi>Gentile</hi> Converts, who ſaw the abſurdity of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Polytheiſm and were told that <hi>Plato</hi>'s and St. <hi>John</hi>'s Expreſſions were the ſame and exactly agreed, imagined that this was a counterfeit Piece of the Platoniſts and Cerinthians, to uphold their Divin Hypoſtaſis diſtinct from the Father, and ſo at firſt gave not themſelves leave to conſider and examin what might be the true Senſe of St. <hi>John's</hi> terms and the Intention of his Goſpel. Howbeit, the Platoniſts in proceſs of time hated and defamed the <hi>

Yet all this Evidence is from the Teſtimony of profeſſed Enemies, there remaining now no other Authors, that expreſly treat of theſe things.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Alogi,</hi> their very Nick-name beſpeaks them to be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians. Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> is the firſt, who gave to them the Name of <hi>Alogi.</hi> Before him, they were ſimply called Chriſtians. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſpeaks of them, as the ancient <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> of the <hi>Gentile Converts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we have, above all other Evidences, an expreſs Teſtimony of the Faith of the Primitive Chriſtians, in their Symbol, juſtly called <hi>the Apoſtles Creed,</hi> which mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly is altogether <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian.</hi> For it is a Profeſſion of Faith in <hi>one God, that is the Father Almighty.</hi> And every thing that is there ſaid of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is the Deſcription, not of an eternal God, but of a Creature or Human Perſon highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted by God. And of the Holy Ghoſt no more is ſaid, but that it is a Holy Spirit, or a Holy Breath or Holy Inſpiration. The Compilers of the Creed pretended to know no more of it. And it is a Generality which the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> highly approve of, but which hitherto the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> ſeem not to be pleaſed to ſtick to. If they were to make a Confeſſion of their Faith, they would not expreſs it as it is here; or, if they did, we would readily agree with them. <hi>To believe in,</hi> is a Phraſe that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies no more than <hi>to believe;</hi> for the Creed teaches us to believe <hi>in the Holy Catholick Church,</hi> as well as <hi>in the Holy Spirit</hi> and <hi>in one God the Father Almighty.</hi> As for the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37508:20"/>Antiquity and Authority of this Creed, we have the unanimous Opinion of the Fathers, as it appears in their Writings and as is obſerved by <hi>Ruffinus</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar who flouriſhed in the Year 360, that it was compiled by the Colledge of the Apoſtles, with the Concurence and Conſent of the 120 Diſciples, (mentioned in <hi>Acts,</hi> 1.15.) who aſſiſted them in their Councils. And it ſeems to be referred to, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Jude.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>In truth, the Divine Providence might well think it ſelf not concerned, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any other Evidence of the Authority and Antiquity of the Chriſtian Syſtem, but this, beſides the <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet we have moreover <hi>the Epiſtle of St. Clemens,</hi> or <hi>Clemens Romanus, to the Corinthians.</hi> That is that <hi>Clemens,</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> not only calls his <hi>Fellow-laborer,</hi> but of whom he ſays that <hi>his Name is written in the Book of Life. Phil.</hi> 4.3. This <hi>Clemens,</hi> being Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> wrote that Epiſtle to the Chriſtians of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in the Name and by the Order of his Church. And this Epiſtle is ſo avowed a Piece of Antiquity, that the Trinitarians dare not diſown it. Howbeit, the moſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Trinitarian Criticks, ſuch as Biſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher, Petavius</hi> and <hi>Huetius</hi> of late, and <hi>Photius</hi> of old, (ſee <hi>Sandi. Hiſt. Secul.</hi> 1.) acknowledge that <hi>Clemens</hi> appears therein an undoubted Unitarian; ſpeaking of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt juſt as the Unitarians do and no otherwiſe, as we ſee, for inſtance, even in theſe words of the 58th. Chapter, <q>God the Inſpector of all things, the Father of Spirits, the Lord of all Fleſh; <hi>who has choſen our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and us by him;</hi> grant to you Peace, Long Suffering, Patience, through <hi>our High Priest and Protector</hi> Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>by whom</hi> be Glory and Honour and Majeſty unto God, now and for evermore.</q> Now let the Trinitarians ſeriouſly conſider, whether they would thus expreſs themſelves, to teach what is to be believed, concerning God, the Father of all, and concerning our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. (See <hi>Sandius</hi>'s <hi>Hiſt. Eccl.</hi> for more expreſs Evidences of <hi>St. Clemens</hi> his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm.</hi>)</p>
               <p>There are alſo <hi>the Recognitions,</hi> which tho' perhaps by Miſtake attributed to St. <hi>Clemens,</hi> yet are very antient, there being a Paſſage taken out of them in a Fragment of <hi>Bardeſanes,</hi> preſerved in <hi>Euſebius</hi> his <hi>Praep. Evang. L.</hi> 6. <hi>C.</hi> 10. They are ſo evidently agreable to the Unitarian Sentiment, that they are confeſſed ſo to be by the Trinitarian Criticks. For a further illuſtration of all theſe particulars, ſee the aforequoted Pamphlet, <hi>The Judgment of the Fathers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>other, remaining, Ante-nicene Writings;</hi> tho they appear to begin to <hi>platonize,</hi> and proceed to do ſo more and more by ſteps, and ſome of them doing it in a pretty high degree, (thoſe that aſſerted the rigid Unitarian Doctrine, or even that Sentiment that <hi>Arius</hi> afterwards was condemned for, thus being in time <hi>in ſome meaſure ſuppreſſed,</hi>) yet generally they are far from the Opinion that is now called Orthodox, and they incline more to the Unitarian Syſtem then to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarian Sentiment of the latter Ages.</p>
               <p>For, firſt, they generally believe not the Holy Ghoſt to be God, or a God in an eminent ſenſe like Him whom they call the God Word, or the Word whom God produced before all things, whom God was pleaſed to make a God or Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign next unto Him, and whom they ſuppoſe God employed, as his Miniſter in Creating the Holy Spirit and Angels, and as his Chief Officer in the Creation of all other things.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:37508:21"/>Secondly, then, they by no means repreſent the Divine Word or Son as actually equal to God, but as an inferiour God, diſtinct from and ſubject to <hi>the Principal God who has no God above him;</hi> and they repreſent him not as a Neceſſary Being, that was generated from all eternity, but as being created of the Divine Subſtance, by the mere good Will and arbitrary Pleaſure of God, immediately before the Creation of the World. Indeed they generally ſeem to make the Duration of Time to commence at the Creation of the World, and ſo ſuppoſe that what was done before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Material World belongs not to the Duration of Time, but to the Duration of Eternity: Nevertheleſs, as was ſaid, they hold not the Son to have been from all Eternity; for they aſſert that once he was not, and they hold that he had a beginning. Yet, according to them, he may be termed eternal, in that he exiſted in God from Eternity, and was produced in that Duration which was before the Creation of the World. In like manner, they reckon him to be equal to God, or (rather) like to God, no otherwiſe than as he is a moſt excellent Being that moſt eminently acts for and repreſents God and was created out of the Subſtance of God, whereas it ſeems they moſt generally hold that other Creatures were made out of Nothing.</p>
               <p>They repreſent the Son to be created out of the Subſtance of God, as the Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our thoughts by Speech is created out of our Thoughts. But they offer their <hi>Philoſophical Speculations</hi> for the moſt part <hi>as Conjectures,</hi> and not <hi>as Articles of Faith.</hi> Eſpecially at firſt they were pretty ſparing and moderate therein. Howbeit, the unfathomable Depths of <hi>Platoniſm</hi> (as it was taught in thoſe Days, and which was then by too many philoſophizing Chriſtians imagined to be in a great meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with Chriſtianity and near the ſame thing with it) made that theſe poor Fathers, often, knew not well, themſelves, or ſeemed not to know, what they ſaid, nor whereof they affirmed. Yet, from the whole, it ſeems, it may be collected, that generally theſe <hi>Platoniſts</hi> inclined to that Opinion which afterwards was called <hi>Semi-Arianiſm.</hi> As was ſaid, they generally own, that the Son was not from all Eternity, and that he is not Equal to the Father: Yet, the <hi>Platonick</hi> Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks, which the <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> World at that time highly admired, as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limeſt Philoſophy and the moſt rational Theology, and which theſe Doctors not only followed before they were Chriſtians, but alſo, when converted, accomodated as much as they could to Chriſtianity, it ſeems, at leaſt, implying, that the Second Perſon of the Trinity was created out of the Subſtance of the Firſt or Chief God, and the Third out of the Subſtance of the Second, yet ſo as that, tho the Third Perſon of this Moſt High Trinity was not ſo Excellent as the Second, nor the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond but of an Inſerior Divinity neither, howbeit bearing the Name of God, and therein particularly ſurpaſſing the Third Divine Perſon, theſe two Perſons, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, (which, tho' Inſerior to the Chief God, were Superior to all the other Gods, or Angels,) remained moſt intimately United, not only with one another, but alſo with the Firſt Perſon of this tranſcendent Trinity, inſomuch that theſe three, being thus United, and being of a like Subſtance, might be ſaid to be one Thing, or as one Being; <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> I ſay, ſeeming at leaſt to import ſomewhat like this, theſe <hi>Platonizing</hi> Fathers therefore by degrees philoſophized among Chriſtians much after that way, as much as can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37508:21"/>by their expreſſions. Indeed, all Creatures may be ſaid in ſome ſenſe to be united to God, and to be in God; for in him we live, and move, and have our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nay, in ſome ſenſe all Creatures may be ſaid to have been in God from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, at leaſt potentially, tho' not brought forth or produc'd from all Eternity, but only when Almighty God created this Univerſe. And even ſome of theſe Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and among them <hi>Tertullian</hi> particularly, expreſly aſſerted, that mere Creatures, in particular Human Souls, were made out of the Subſtance of God. Howbeit, <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſm</hi> implying that the Son and the Spirit are above all other Creatures, the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> generally held that the Son at leaſt or even the Son and the Spirit are moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly of the Subſtance of God, were moſt peculiarly in him, and were moſt pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly united to him, ſo as that whereever the Son went, and whatever he did, God as it were had always a ſtrict hold of him, and wrought with, in and by him. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, as was ſaid, they repreſented the Son and Spirit as Diſtinct and Inferior Beings, ſo that they own'd the Father to be properly the Supreme Being, and to be the only Perſon conſequently that is properly God, or a God in the eminent Senſe of the word <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and, in a word, all the Primitive Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors that were converted out of <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> had been taught <hi>Platoniſm;</hi> and, when they were become Chriſtians, they openly profeſſed, in all-their Writings, that they were ſtill great admirers of that <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and they maintain'd that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and <hi>Plato</hi>'s Trinity was much the ſame. Thus they introduced <hi>Platoniſm</hi> in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Syſtem, accommodating the one to the other as near as they could. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> it ſeems, particularly began openly to Platonize; and the reſt followed after him. And then they for the moſt part repreſented the <hi>Platonick</hi> Trinity very like <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> any of 'em at moſt making it <hi>Semi-Arianiſm,</hi> &amp; ſo, that the generality of Chriſtians might, it ſeems, miſtake it for <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> the good Fathers, either purpoſely or otherwiſe, expreſſing themſelves very obſeurely in a moſt Obſcure Matter tho' ſome more Platonically than others. Theſe, in compariſon of thoſe that followed, were <hi>Moderate Platoniſts,</hi> and ſcarce any or but few went further in the 2d. Century, or at leaſt till towards the end of the 2d. Century, whereas afterwards, it ſeems, there aroſe among Chriſtians ſeveral violent Opinioniſts and ſierce <hi>Semi-Arians,</hi> and then many rigid, and thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paced, or very heatheniſh <hi>Platonists,</hi> true Polytheiſts, that perhaps went even farther than <hi>Platoniſm</hi> it ſelf, and maintain'd much the ſame Notions, concerning the Son, that are laid down in Dr. <hi>Sherlocks</hi> Books. Not but that in the beginning of the 4th. Century, at the time of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> there were a great many of the moſt Learned Biſhops that were ſtill <hi>Semi-Arians,</hi> and ſeveral but <hi>Arians,</hi> moſt credibly according to the Doctrin that anciently was chiefly in vogue, before <hi>Semi-Arianiſm</hi> was eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Juſtin Martyr.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Semi-Arians,</hi> or <hi>Mildeſt Platonists,</hi> like the <hi>Arians,</hi> defended the Unity of God, by ſaying, that the Father only was <hi>the Supreme</hi> or <hi>Principal God,</hi> and that God the Word was not only Leſſer than he, but alſo Subject to him; wherefore they concluded, it might truly be ſaid, that, in Heaven and in the whole World, there is but One God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or but one God, tho' there be God the Father, and God the Son, as in a Houſe where there is a Son Subject to his Father it may be ſaid that there is but one Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one Maſterſhip or one Maſter, the one not being eſſentially different from the other when both of them perfectly agree. This is ſo well known to have been the ſenſe of the generality of theſe <hi>Ante-nicene</hi> Fathers whoſe Writings have in ſome meaſure been preſerved, as well as of many ſince, that it is needleſs to take much pains to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37508:22"/>prove it. Howbeit, it will not be improper to give here ſome Inſtances of it. And, firſt, for the conveniency of ſome Readers, it may be uſeful to make theſe Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Remarks.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Dalaeus,</hi> (towards the middle of the fifth Chap. of his firſt Book <hi>De <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſ. Pat.</hi>) not diſtinguiſhing <hi>Semi-Arianiſm</hi> from <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> opines, that it is impoſſible to clear St. <hi>Juſtin</hi> from being an <hi>Arian,</hi> that Father aſſerting, <q>that the God, who appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> was the Son and not the Father, inaſmuch as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never changes Place, neither comes up nor down, and no Man therefore ever ſaw the Father, but the Son only has been ſeen, who is the Father's Miniſter, and a God alſo by the Father's Will.</q> Now, ſays <hi>Dalaeus,</hi> is not this to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to God the Son a Nature and Being different from that of God the Father? Nay, he might have added, is not this alſo to aſcribe to him an inferior and a preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Being?</p>
               <p>As the ſame <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſays to the ſame purpoſe in other Places; <q>God in the beginning, before all the Creatures,</q> (that is to ſay before all the other Creatures, or mere Creatures, and immediately before the Creation of the World, for that is the ſtrain of <hi>theſe</hi> Platoniſts,) <q>generated of himſelf a certain Rational Power, one while called <hi>the Son,</hi> another while <hi>Wiſdom, an Angel, God, Lord</hi> and <hi>Word.</hi> For he may be called by all theſe Names, both becauſe he <hi>Miniſtreth</hi> to the Will of the Father, and was <hi>voluntarily</hi> Begotten of the Father. <bibl>(<hi>Colloq. cum.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Irenaeus</hi> (who even was a Diſciple of the Contemporaries of the Apoſtles, his Maſter <hi>Polycarpus</hi> having been a Diſciple and Companion of St. <hi>John,</hi> and of ſome others that had ſeen the Lord, and who was, himſelf, as well as <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> generally in great eſteem among Chriſtians, tho' every one knows he was alſo a follower and great admirer of <hi>Plato</hi>) ſpeaks much to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>The Church,</hi> ſays he, <hi>diſperſed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37508:22"/>thro' the whole World, has, both from the Apoſtles and their Diſciples, received that Faith, which is in one God the Father Almighty; and in one Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, incarnated for our Salvation; and in one Holy Spirit, who by the Prophets publiſhed the Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God.—Jeſus Chriſt is our Lord, and God, and Saviour, and King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good Pleaſure of the Inviſible Father.</hi> (adverſ. haeres. L. 1. C. 2.) <hi>He, who has no other God above him, is the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> (Ib. C. 19.) And in ſpeaking of that Saying of Chriſt, that he knew not the Day and Hour of Judgment, he ſays; <hi>The Father is above all things; for the Father, ſays Chriſt, is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than I: Wherefore in knowledge alſo, the Father is declared to have the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence.</hi> (Ib. L. 2. C. 49.) <hi>The Apoſtles would not call any one of his own Perſor. Lord, but him that exerciſeth Lordſhip over all, even God the Father, and his Son, who has received from the Father the Lordſhip of all the Creation.</hi> (Ib. L. 3. C. 6.) <hi>The Apoſtles confeſſed the Father and Son to be God and Lord, but neither named any other God, nor confeſſed any other to be Lord.</hi> (Ib. C. 9.) <hi>I invocate thee, O Lord, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who art the only true God, above whom there is no other God, who ruleſt over all, and doſt, in domination, beſides our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, rule alſo over the Holy Spirit.</hi> (Ib. C. 6.) By theſe Paſſages it appears, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> held the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone to be God in the moſt eminent ſenſe of that word, and the Son to be Lord and God under the Father, but the Holy Spirit to be neither Lord nor God. Yet he might hold the Holy Spirit to be above the Angels, and 'tis probable he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood thereby what the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> do. Theſe Matters being left in a great Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in Scripture, the Fathers explained them as they thought beſt. That liberty of inquiry and examination muſt be allowed of, ſo thoſe explications and interpretations be but offer'd as Opinions and Conjectures, but be not Magiſterially impoſed by any Man on other Men. For, to follow the Deſign and Intention of Scripture, Chriſtians muſt Unite in the Generality of the Terms of Scripture, as we ſee it in the Apoſtles Creed. If theſe Meaſures had always been obſerved, <hi>Platoniſm</hi> had done but little harm. It ſeems that <hi>Platoniſm</hi> made the <hi>Platonizing</hi> Fathers differ from the ſtrict <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> and <hi>Arians,</hi> I mean, the Ancient and Primitive Chriſtians that held the Sentiment that <hi>Arius</hi> revived or improved. For it ſeems he believed, after them, that <hi>the Word,</hi> like other Creatures, was made out of Nothing. But, it ſeems, <hi>Plato,</hi> as after him his Chriſtian Diſciples, (of the Number of whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſeems to be,) taught that <hi>the Word</hi> was created out of the Subſtance of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dalaeus</hi> obſerves, in the laſt quoted Place of his aforeſaid Book, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> (tho' the moſt thorow-ſtitcht <hi>Platoniſt</hi> of his time) had much the ſame Thoughts, and held, that God the Father produced the Word out of himſelf and made him his Son, but that the Father is the whole Subſtance and the Son a Portion and Derivation of that whole.</p>
               <p>In another Place, the ſame <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſays expreſly, that <hi>there was a time when the Son was not,</hi> (<hi>Adv. Hermogen. C.</hi> 3.) and it ſeems that by the Holy Spirit-he means only the Vertue and Power of God. (<hi>De Praeſcript. C.</hi> 13.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Novatian</hi> ſays, that the Holy Spirit is <hi>leſs than Chriſt,</hi> (<hi>De Trin. C.</hi> 24.) more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that once the Son was not, and that <hi>before him was nothing beſides the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> (<hi>C.</hi> 11.) Whereby he poſitively aſſerts, that the Father alone is from all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and conſequently that the Father alone is God in the eminent Senſe of that word. Which is very different from the Sentiment of the rigid <hi>Platoniſts</hi> and the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37508:23"/>preſent <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> who hold the Son and Holy Spirit to be from all Eternity as well as the Father, and to be equal among themſelves and co-equal with him, as it is in the Creed of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> Now thoſe that do not aſſert the Son and Spirit to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, and conſequently not to have a neceſſary Exiſtence, nor unlimited Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor unborrowed Powers, or Powers that they have not received freely from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, may very well paſs for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians;</hi> ſeeing they make not the Son and Spirit to be God like the Father, but the Father's Creatures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dalaeus,</hi> in the Place we laſt quoted, remarks that thoſe expreſſions, which afterwards were ſo much found ſault with in <hi>Arius,</hi> were uſed by theſe <hi>Antenicene:</hi> be mentions <hi>Dionyſius Arexandrinus,</hi> who expreſly calls the Son <hi>the Father's Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> which is the ſame as to ſay, <hi>the Father's Creature.</hi> They expreſly ſay, that the Father <hi>Made</hi> the Son, and they even uſe the very term that the Father <hi>Created</hi> him. Nay, <hi>Dalaeus,</hi> in the ſame Place, forgets not to take notice, that the 80 <hi>Platonick</hi> Biſhops, who, at the latter end of the 3d. Century, (ſo violently) condemned the famous Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> yet at the ſame time did expreſly declare, <hi>that the Son is not of the ſame Eſſence with the Father.</hi> Now therefore, by the Acknowledgement of the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> themſelves, the <hi>Poſt-Nicene Trinitarians</hi> cannot with any Modeſty pretend, that the <hi>Ancients</hi> were of the ſame Opinion with them; and conſequently there can be nothing more vain, than for them to plead <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Origen,</hi> like the foregoing Authors, not only called the Son <hi>a Second God,</hi> (<hi>Contr. Cel. L.</hi> 5. p. 258.) but <hi>a Creature,</hi> and <hi>the oldeſt of the Creatures.</hi> (<hi>Ib.</hi> p. 257.) And in his Firſt and Second Books concerning <hi>Prayer,</hi> he has ſo many Arguments againſt <hi>Praying</hi> to any but the <hi>Father,</hi> and ſo blames thoſe that would alſo direct their <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> to the <hi>Son,</hi> plainly calling them <hi>Fools</hi> for ſo doing, that it clearly appears, that, according to him, the Supreme or true <hi>Divinity</hi> belong'd to the <hi>Father</hi> only. This is ſo notorious, that many have believed, that <hi>Origen</hi> was of the ſame Opinion that <hi>Arius</hi> afterwards was of; and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did well obſerve, that in many Places <hi>Origen</hi> makes the Son and Holy Spirit to be of another kind of God-head, or of another Nature and Eſſence, than that of the Father. (<hi>Epiphan. adv. Haer. L.</hi> 2. <hi>T.</hi> 1. p. 531.) Now, ſince ſo antient, ſo renowned and learned a Doctor, as <hi>Origen,</hi> was of this Sentiment, that alone is a ſufficient Argument, that the Notion of the preſent <hi>Trinitarians</hi> was not then known to be the Apoſtolick Doctrin, that at leaſt the <hi>Tradition</hi> about that Point is uncertain, and conſequently that the <hi>Determination</hi> thereof ought not to be ſought for <hi>by this Means.</hi> Indeed, in reaſon, ſo <hi>Abſtruſe</hi> and <hi>Intricate</hi> a Matter ought to be <hi>Magiſterially</hi> determined by <hi>no</hi> Means, if they are not attended with greater evidence; but every one muſt be allowed to judge the beſt he can for himſelf, and Men muſt Unite in the uſe of the terms, and expreſſions, themſelves, of <hi>Scripture,</hi> if they appear to be ſuſceptible of a great <hi>Generality,</hi> and perhaps deſignedly indeterminable, and if there lie invincible Difficulties, and unanſwerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, not to ſay Demonſtrations, againſt the <hi>(Platonick) Trinitarian</hi> Syſtem. Howbeit, as we ſhall further ſee, the <hi>Scripture</hi> muſt be own'd to be the only <hi>Rule</hi> herein to be ſought to, beſides the clear and inconteſtable Dictates of <hi>Reaſon;</hi> and the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> if they be ſincere, muſt acknowledge, that their Plea of <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is vain and frivolous. None but Quacks can talk at Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s rate, that <hi>the whole Catholick Church in all Ages</hi> has been of his Sentiment, or of the Sentiment of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37508:23"/>the preſent <hi>Trinitarians;</hi> and that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Controverſy may be decided by the Judgment of the ancient <hi>(Ante-nicene)</hi> Authors, whoſe Writings have in part been ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come to our Hands. It appears evidently, that the <hi>Ante-nicene</hi> were not of the Opinion that is now termed Orthodox. To evince which Poſition of ours, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuperfluous to add many more Proofs, after what we have alledged out of theſe moſt ancient and famous Authors. I ſhall therefore only add two or three Paſſages out of the following Writers, which, tho' not altogether ſo ancient as the foregoing, yet come not ſo much ſhort of it as to deſerve to be wholly unregarded. They were very eminent and learned Men. It cannot be doubted but that they knew what Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, in, as well as ſomtime before, their time, was held as Orthodox, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd in that rigorous Age to be held as ſuch. And it is credible they would not have publickly aſſerted any thing in theſe Matters, that would then have drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the Cenſures of the Church, in the Communion of which they flouriſhed, and in which they were deſirous to be in great eſteem. Nevertheleſs, it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, their Opinion, as well as that of the afore-quoted Authors, is very different from that of the preſent <hi>Platonick</hi> or <hi>Scholaſtick Trinitarians.</hi> For inſtance, then.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arnobius</hi> declared, in the Treatiſe he wrote to inform the Gentiles with the Truths of Chriſtianity, that Chriſtians did indeed hold Chriſt to be a God, but inferior to the Father, and a leſſer God than He who alone is the Almighty God. Chriſt, ſays he, is a God, who, in the form of a Man, ſpake to the World, <hi>by the Command of the Principal God.</hi> (<hi>Adv. Gent. L.</hi> 2. p. 106.) <hi>The Almighty God, who is the only God, at length ſent out Chriſt.</hi> (Ib. p. 120.) How could he have taught more plainly, or more expreſly, that the Father alone is the Almighty God, and the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, or the only Perſon that is God in the eminent ſenſe of that word? Not but that he might hold both Chriſt and the Holy Spirit to be alſo Divine Perſons. But 'tis evident he reckons them to be of an inferior kind, ſeeing he denies them to be the Almighty, the Principal and Only God. He makes them therefore Creatures, tho' created Gods, whether or no created out of the very Subſtance of the Almighty God. He comes then very near to <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> if he be not altogether <hi>Arian.</hi> He looks upon the Almighty Father, as the only Fountain of all Being and Perfection, and as able, not only to produce other Beings, but to communicate to whom he will immenſe or vaſt Perfections and a Divine Nature, tho' inferior to his, becauſe there can be but one Infinite and Almighty Being: Wherefore all Creatures, tho' never ſo Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Excellent, can have but limited Perfections, and muſt ever remain ſubject to the Almighty? Now who doth not ſee, that this is to aſſert but one God properly ſo called, or but one who is the Almighty God, the Principal or Supreme God, and the Only God? And is not that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, tho' <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſaid, that in the 2d. Century the Holy Angels were worſhipped (particularly, it may be, by ſome Platoniſts) <hi>Arnobius</hi> declares that in his time Chriſtians thought it ſufficient to worſhip God, even God the Father, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal God. Howbeit, ſays he, <hi>to diſcharge the Worſhip of Divinity, the Chief God is ſufficient for us: (I ſay) the Chief God, the Father and Lord of all Things. In him we worſhip whatſoever is to be worſhipped. For we have in him the very Head of Divinity, from whence the Divinity of all Divine Things whatſoever is derived.</hi> If the <hi>Platonick Trinitarians</hi> had always kept ſtrictly to this Generality in their Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, there needed have been no Diſagreement nor Diviſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:37508:24"/>It is evident that in the ſecond and third Centuries, after that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and the other converted Philoſophers had introduced their Platoniſm in the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the Primitive <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> were indeed commonly viliſied and oppoſed, but yet the Platoniſts kept not all alike at the ſame diſtance from theſe, but ſomewhat differed among themſelves, and allowed of that difference; not being then agreed how much juſtly of Platoniſm was to be admitted or held neceſſary, nor knowing how to determine a Matter that ſeemed ſo obſcure and abſtruſe. The Nature of the H. Ghoſt eſpecially was then left undetermined. The generality not only of the old Chriſtians, but even of the new Platonick Doctors, own'd him to be but the Power and Inſpiration of God, or elſe took him for an Archangel, and a created Spirit like the other Angels, but above all the Angels. And therefore if there were at thoſe times any rigid Platoniſts that had much the ſame Notion that the preſent <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians</hi> have of the H. Spirit. they contented themſelves covertly or modeſtly to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert or intimate their Opinion, but durſt not and could not attempt imperiouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thoſe that were not of their Sentiment. We ſee, the generality of the <hi>Ante-nicene</hi> agree, that the H. Ghoſt is not God, tho' ſome call him a Divine Perſon, but none of them would have made difficulty ſo to have called any Angel; thoſe that called him the Power of God, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and others, yet expreſly affirmed that he was not God, and ſo it ſeems took him not to be a real Divine Perſon, or a real Divine Being, but an Act, or an Influence and Inſpiration of the the Divin Power, or an Archangel, or both, or they knew not what. And thoſe that poſitively called him a Creature, were not cenſuredeven by the higheſt Platoniſts of thoſe times. And as touching the Nature of the Son or Word of God, it ſeems that then <hi>Semi-Arianiſm</hi> did moſt prevail among the Doctors, even perhaps from the 2d. Century; but yet till the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> the (ſuppos'd) ancient Doctrin after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards called <hi>Arianiſm</hi> was allowed of in the Church, at leaſt in a great meaſure, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally for a good while approved before. For moſt probably many of thoſe ancient Writings, that were ſupreſſed after the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> (as containing a Doctrin that was then in a great meaſure grown out of Date, tho' the avowed Works of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent &amp; learned Biſhops of the Church) aſſerted the Scriptural Sentiment for (it ſeems) at leaſt the like to which <hi>Arius</hi> was condemn'd at <hi>Nice.</hi> And we ſee that ſeveral of thoſe <hi>Ante-nicene,</hi> that have been permitted to come to our hands, ſo expreſs themſelves that they may be taken for <hi>Arians.</hi> Howbeit, it ſuffices us if they generally appear to be but <hi>Semi-Arians.</hi> For then it is evident the preſent <hi>Trinitarians</hi> cannot juſtly plead <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The celebrated Writings of <hi>Lactantius</hi> are a further Teſtimony to what I have ſaid, concerning the State of <hi>the Platonick Trinitarianiſm</hi> in the Church <hi>before the Council of Nice.</hi> He aſſerts, that <hi>God, before he ſet upon this ourious Work of the World, begat an incorruptible and irreproveable Spirit, that he might call him his Son. Altho' God produced, alſo, for his Service, infinite others, whom we call Angels; yet he has vouchſafed to give the Name of Son but to his Firſt-born.</hi> (Inſtit. L. 4. C. 6.) And <hi>becauſe</hi> the Son <hi>was faithful</hi> to God, and taught Mankind <hi>that there is one God, and that he alone is to be worſhipped, neither did ever call himſelf a God, becauſe he had not diſcharged his Truſt;</hi> therefore <hi>he received the Dignity of a Perpetual Prieſt, and the Honor of a Soveraign King, and the Power of a Judg, and the Name of God.</hi> (Ib. C. 13.) <hi>Now when any one has a Son, whom he entirely loves, who notwithſtanding dwells in the Houſe, and under the Governing Power of his Father, altho' the Father grants him
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37508:24"/>the Name and Authority of a Maſter; yet, in the terms of Civilians, here is but one Houſe, and one Maſter. So this World is but one Houſe belonging to God; and the Son and the Father who inhabit the World, and who are of one Mind,</hi> (or of like Affections and perfectly agree,) <hi>are</hi> as One Government or <hi>One only God; the One being as the Two, and the Two as the One. And no marvel, ſince the Son is in the Father, becauſe the Father loveth the Son, and the Father is in the Son, by reaſon of his faithful Reſignation to his Fathers Will, and that he does nothing but what the Father Commands him.</hi> This evidently declares in what ſenſe the Father and Son are to be underſtood to be One God or One Mind and One Spirit, Namely, inaſmuch as they are of one Mind, they are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as if they were but one Spirit, or but one Perſon and one God. Yet, according to this, they really are Two diſtinct Beings, and Two very unequal Spirits. For the Son has freely received all from the Father, and is ever Inferior and Subject to the Father, and was produced then when God was going to ſet himſelf upon the Creating of the World, and conſequently is not from all Eternity. The Father then is the Firſt and Principal God; and the Son is a God of a lower kind. If this be not pure <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> as it may be taken and ſeems to be, all that it can amount to is at moſt <hi>Semi-Arianiſm,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very little differs from <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> for both Syſtems hold the Son to be God but in an Inferior ſenſe, and aſſert the Father alone to be the one only true God tho' the <hi>Semi-Arians</hi> eſteem that the Son was Created out of the Fathers Nature or Subſtance, whereas <hi>Arius</hi> and thoſe that are exactly of his Opinion, as was ſaid, conceive that the Son, tho' immediately produced by the Father, was Created out of Nothing, and only differs from other Creatures, in that he is more Excellent than they all put together, was Created by the Father alone, and is ſet by the Father over all created Beings.</p>
               <p>As concerning the Perſon and Nature of the Holy Spirit, <hi>Dalaeus,</hi> in the Fourth Chap. of his Second Book <hi>De uſu Patrum,</hi> remarks, after St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> that <hi>Lactantius</hi> expreſly aſſerts the Holy Ghoſt to be but a Creature and not to partake of the Deity (<hi>Sandius</hi> brings many Inſtances, to prove that both <hi>Lactantius</hi> and all the other fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Authors were even of <hi>Arius</hi> his Sentiment, and not they only, but alſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the remaining <hi>Ante-nicene</hi> Writers.)</p>
               <p>All theſe Authors, which we have quoted, were undoubtedly moſt learned and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly eſteem'd in their Generations, and are now generally eſteem'd ſtill by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and indeed they may be accounted the <hi>Chief</hi> of <hi>the Ante-nicene whoſe Writings have been preſerved:</hi> (We may alſo rank among them <hi>Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> as well as <hi>Lactantius,</hi> ſince he Flouriſhed ſomtime before, as well as ſince, the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and appears to follow wholly the Sentiments of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> when not aw'd by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Tyranny;) ſo that the then current <hi>Ante-nicene</hi> Doctrin may be known in theſe Writings.</p>
               <p>Concerning theſe Matters, (therefore,) we may remark, <hi>Euſebius</hi> expreſſes himſelf to this purpoſe. <hi>He that is beyond all things, the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Christ, the Governor of all things, how many, and of what quality ſoever they be, even of the Holy Spirit himſelf, yea further of the Only Begotten Son alſo, is deſervedly ſtiled by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle the God that is over all, and he only may be called the one God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Christ: But the Son is the Only Begotten God, who is in the Boſom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, is neither God, nor Son; for he has not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Production from the Father like the Son, but is one of thoſe things which were made by the Son.</hi> (De Eccleſiaſt. Theol. L. 3. C. 6.) <hi>If</hi> John <hi>had conceived the Father
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37508:25"/>and the Son to be one and the ſame thing, he would have ſaid, that the Word was the God, with the Addition of the Article; which not doing, he evidently teaches us, that he is the Prime God who is the Father of the Word, and that the Word was not that very God, but yet that he alſo was a God.</hi> (Ib. L. 2. C. 17.)</p>
               <p>This is the Current Doctrin of the Old <hi>Ante-nicene Platoniſts</hi> concerning <hi>the Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost. Euſebius,</hi> like the other before him, expreſly aſſerts that the Holy Ghoſt is not God; and it is viſible, he ſays no more of the Son than at moſt what is agreable to <hi>Semi-Arianiſm.</hi> That was, it ſeems, what the generality of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive or Ancient <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Euſebius,</hi> in the 25th. and laſt Chap. of the 5th. Book of his Hiſtory, quotes a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Paſſage of an Author (a Platonizing Chriſtian) who had written upon that account againſt the moſt rigid <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians.</hi> The Paſſage is to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> pretend, that <hi>the Apoſtles</hi> and all <hi>the Ancients</hi> held the very Doctrine, concerning the Perſon of our Saviour, that is now maintained by the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians;</hi> and that it is but only ſince the Times of the Popes <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pherin,</hi> that the Truth has been adulterated and diſcountenanced. This would be credible, if, firſt, the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Doctrin were not contrary to Holy Scripture; and if divers before <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Zepherin</hi> had not contended for the Divinity of the <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> Namely, <hi>Juſtin Martyr, Miltiades, Tatianus, Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Irenaeus, Melito.</hi> To whom we may add the ancient Hymns or Pſalms, <hi>wrote from the beginning by the Brethren;</hi> which ſpeak of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and attribute to him <hi>Divinity.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this Famous Paſſage, theſe Remarks may be made. 1. Whereas theſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient (rigid) <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> ſaid, that the Primitive Doctrin was adulterated in the Times of <hi>Victor,</hi> their Meaning without doubt was not that before him there was never a <hi>Platonick</hi> Chriſtian, but only that the <hi>Platonick</hi> Chriſtians <hi>then prevailed,</hi> and grew <hi>violent</hi> and began to diſcountenance the Truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All thoſe Writers, whom this Author, or Anſwerer, and Antagoniſt of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> mentions as the Ancienteſt Aſſertors of the Divinity of the Word after the <hi>Platonick</hi> Syſtem, were, except <hi>Juſtin,</hi> but Contemporaries to <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Zepherin,</hi> or after them. (As for thoſe <hi>Hymns</hi> which he ſpeaks of, we ſhall ſee that no ſtreſs can be laid on them, or that they conclude nothing againſt the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians.</hi>) Hereby then the Novelty of the <hi>Platonick</hi> Chriſtianity appears, ſeeing no vouchers for it can be produced before <hi>Juſtin Martyr;</hi> and it is therefore evident that what the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> ſaid could not be diſproved, that the Times of <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Zepherin</hi> were the Fatal Epoche of <hi>the violent Oppoſition and Oppreſſion of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm,</hi> ſeeing that the Crowd of fierce Antagoniſts <hi>then</hi> began, and it cannot be ſhewn, that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Doctrin was before <hi>then</hi> perſecuted and diſcountenanced, or that it was not, during all the firſt Century, the current Doctrin of the generality of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is probable that ſome of <hi>the Writers</hi> whom that Author <hi>oppoſes</hi> to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> were but of that Sentiment which was afterwards ſo unjuſtly condemned in <hi>Arius:</hi> Why elſe had their <hi>Writings</hi> been <hi>ſuppreſſed</hi> by the <hi>Platoniſts?</hi> Perhaps, alſo, by <hi>the Word</hi> and <hi>the Spirit</hi> they underſtood <hi>two Divine Powers,</hi> or <hi>Influences,</hi> which God communicates in divers manners and degrees. It was eaſy for the <hi>philoſophizing</hi> Doctors, following <hi>Plato</hi>'s Notions and accommodating them to the Expreſſions of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37508:25"/>Scripture, by thoſe <hi>two Powers</hi> or <hi>Influences</hi> to underſtand ſo many <hi>Perſons</hi> or <hi>Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and ſo to alter inſenſibly the Primitive Doctrin; which if they had not done, they would not have <hi>ſuppreſſed</hi> the <hi>Writings</hi> of their <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> but they judg'd that to be the only way effectually to compaſs their deſign.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As to thoſe <hi>Hymns</hi> or <hi>Pſalms</hi> in queſtion, which, he ſays, ſpake of Chriſt as <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and which attributed to him <hi>Divinity,</hi> nothing can from thence be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded againſt the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> for the following reaſons. Firſt, taking thoſe terms in a right ſenſe, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> will by no means deny that Chriſt is <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and that <hi>Divinity</hi> may be attributed to him. We have ſeen that very eminent Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors among the Primitive Chriſtians called the Angels <hi>Gods;</hi> much more then might they give <hi>that Name</hi> to Chriſt. It would indeed have been ſomthing to the purpoſe, if that Author could have pleaded, that <hi>thoſe Pſalms,</hi> of which he ſpeaks, aſcribed to Chriſt <hi>the ſame</hi> or an <hi>equal</hi> Divinity with that of the Father, or expreſſed that he was abſolutely Eternal, and of himſelf Omniſcient, like the Father. But merely in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral their attributing Divinity to Chriſt, decides nothing, not only conſidering the improper way of ſpeaking of thoſe (tho' ſo early) Times after the Apoſtles, but alſo conſidering that the Scripture gives the Name of God to ſome Creatures. And in Ch. 5th. we obſerved, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> ever thought it their Duty to Sing Hymns in Honour to Chriſt. Howbeit, Secondly, that Author produces no grounds for the Authority of <hi>thoſe Pſalms</hi> which he mentions. He only affirms that they <hi>were wrote from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by the Brethren;</hi> but that is precariouſly ſaid, without any Proofs. If he had had any evidence for his aſſertion, no doubt he would have offered it, and would, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, (if that could have done it,) have convinced or confounded the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians.</hi> But ſurely it was not fit for them to take things upon truſt. Satan, then chiefly, made it his particular buſineſs, by his Emiſſaries, to bring in what confuſion he could by forg'd Writings. If <hi>thoſe Pſalms</hi> had not been ſpurious and counterfeit, the Authors or Primitive Abettors of them had been named. It is probable that theſe were <hi>the Pſalms</hi> that were cenſured by the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> as <hi>new and dangerous.</hi> See <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi>'s <hi>Eccleſ. Hist.</hi> L. 7. C. 29.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Aſſertion of the Unitarians, <hi>that Victor and Zepherin were the firſt Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm,</hi> is undeniably confirm'd by this conſideration, that the <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> before thoſe Popes, looked even on the moſt rigid ſorts of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> as their Brethren, ſuffered thoſe among them, and owned them as Chriſtians, who not only believed Chriſt not to have pre-exiſted before his Conception in his Mothers Womb, but who alſo held that he was a mere Man, begotten like other Men, and that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was truly his Father, God, as they thought, having only removed, for that once, ſome Obſtacles which hindred the Virgin from being a Mother. Notwithſtanding the reputed groſneſs of this Error, we ſee that <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> the Patriarch of the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,</hi> acknowledges that it is not deſtructive of Chriſtianity. For he thus argues with <hi>Trypho</hi> the <hi>Jew. If I do not demonſtrate that Jeſus did pre-exiſt, and according to the Counſel of the Father endured to be Born a Man of like Affections with us, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Fleſh, it is juſt and fit to ſay that I am miſtaken in this only, and not to deny that he is the Chriſt, if he appear to be a Man born of Men, and to have become the Chriſt by Election. For there are ſome of our kind, who confeſs him to be the Chriſt, yet hold him to be a Man born of Men. To whom I aſſent not; no, not tho' very many of the ſame Opinion with me ſhould ſpeak it,</hi> &amp;c. (Col. cum Tryphon. Jud. P. 207.) One may
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:37508:26"/>perceive how wary or artificial <hi>Juſtin</hi> here is in his Expreſſions, as if moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in his time were already Platoniſts. It is credible that they were not the greateſt number who held that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>Joſephs</hi> Son; 'tis certain many of the <hi>Ebionites</hi> were of another Opinion; (<hi>Euſeb. L.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 24.) moſt probably, the generality of Chriſtians believed, like our <hi>Socinians</hi> and the reſt of the preſent Chriſtians, that Chriſt had no other Father but God; and if that was the Apoſtles Sentiment which <hi>Arius</hi> afterwards defended, at leaſt we may imagin that it did then ſtill prevail with many. But <hi>Juſtin,</hi> as we have ſeen, ſeems to have held ſomthing more than this, tho' very different from the <hi>Nicene,</hi> or <hi>Poſt-Nicene</hi> Platoniſts; and it is not impoſſible, not only that his Sentiment was confounded (or generally taken for much the ſame) with that which afterwards <hi>Arius</hi> was of, the which it is credible was then (in <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s time) the moſt current Standard of Orthodoxy, but alſo that ſeveral others Platonized <hi>then</hi> like him, a little above <hi>Arianiſm.</hi> Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs <hi>Juſtin</hi> dares not be too poſitive for his Opinion, he propoſes it only as probable, and he inſinuates that very many were not of his Sentiment; which, one would be apt to think, implies that moſt Chriſtians differed from him, or that he ſomewhat differed from them, for it ſeems he ſpeaks like one whoſe Party is not moſt prevailing. We may refer it to the preſent <hi>Trinitarians;</hi> whether they do talk at that rate? He owns, not merely the <hi>Arians,</hi> but the very <hi>Mineans,</hi> for his Fellow Chriſtians. And indeed he doth, like thoſe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that their Sentiment is not generally followed; he appeals to the Rule: <hi>To whom,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I aſſent not; tho' very many ſhould ſpeak it; for we are commanded, by Chriſt himſelf, not to hearken to the Doctrines of Men, but to ſuch things as are taught by the Sacred Writers,</hi> Yet, as I have ſaid, probably there were ſtill many <hi>Arians,</hi> and I do alſo believe ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beſides <hi>Juſtin</hi> probably began then with him to Platonize; but it is not doubted but that he was the higheſt Chriſtian Platoniſt of that time, if he went beyond <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> which even ſome take to be <hi>Platoniſm,</hi> and the top of it, but that is commonly rejected as undervaluing the Platonick Myſteries: Howbeit, there is not the leaſt appearance that any Platonick Chriſtians went then any further than what we call <hi>Semi-Arianiſm,</hi> It cannot be but that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> knew and own'd that <hi>Juſtin</hi> and ſome others then were of that Opinion, if it was indeed ſo. And truly it matters not how many then ſided therein with <hi>Juſtin.</hi> For, howſoever that be, it ſuffices us that the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm</hi> was not then condemned, as intolerable in the Church, or as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Chriſtianity. And that appears inconteſtably from <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s Words. Therefore the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> might well ſay, that the Truth was not yet <hi>publickly</hi> adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, in that it was not yet <hi>magiſterially</hi> condemned, which we do not ſee it was before the (prevailing, and violent, <hi>Semi-Arian</hi>) Popes <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Zepherin,</hi> according to the Plea of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians.</hi> And indeed they might have added, that the <hi>Semi-A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> themſelves were but a kind of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Authority, then, in fine, that remains for our Author to have recourſe to, is that of the <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi> And there the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> are ready to join iſſue with him, as ſhall be ſhewn.</p>
               <p>It were now needleſs to add any thing more to what has here been ſaid, to ſhew that the generality of the <hi>Ante-nicene</hi> Writers (as much as may be gathered by the Writings of them, that have been thought fit to be preſerved or that have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come to our hands) were at moſt but <hi>Semi-Arians,</hi> if not <hi>Arians,</hi> or <hi>ſtricter <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> as inconteſtably many of them were. (<hi>Euſebius</hi> himſelf will generally paſs for a kind of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian,</hi> whatever be ſaid or pretended to the contrary.) If
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37508:26"/>the Reader deſires to ſee further Proofs of theſe Points, I refer him to <hi>Gilbert Clerk's Ante-Niceniſmus,</hi> and the two other Tracts annexed to it. But this truth is ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that it even forces an acknowledgement from the generality of the learnedeſt <hi>Trinitarian Criticks,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Eraſmus, Dalaeus, Petavius, Huetius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe Learned Men manifeſtly ſhew, that <hi>Arius</hi> was not the Author of the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he defended againſt <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Party at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> but that it was much the ſame, or exactly the ſame, with what the generality of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te-nicene</hi> Doctors had taught. See, for inſtance, what <hi>Sandius,</hi> in his <hi>Nucleus</hi> or <hi>Hiſt. Eccl. enucleata,</hi> quotes, on that Subject, out of <hi>Petavius;</hi> the Place may be found, in look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Petavius,</hi> in the <hi>Index.</hi> So that it is certainly a true remark, that when <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Poſt-Nicene</hi> Doctors call <hi>Arianiſm</hi> an <hi>unheard of</hi> or <hi>new</hi> Doctrin, they ſpeak it <hi>oratorio more et per exaggerationem,</hi> as <hi>Petavius</hi> expreſſes it, that is, <hi>by way of exaggeration and after the manner of Orators,</hi> whoſe Figures by being too lofty ſomtimes decline from the Truth. We have ſeen, in our 6th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by a Quotation of <hi>Dalaeus</hi> out of St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> that the good Fathers, who are ſo much admir'd, and whom ſome would take for their Rule, were not wholly exempt from ſuch <hi>Figures.</hi> And therefore that they might call <hi>Arianiſm</hi> a <hi>new</hi> and <hi>ſtrange</hi> Doctrin, it was enough that themſelves and ſome of their Party had been taught <hi>Semi-Arianiſm,</hi> or one Step farther, by their <hi>Platonick</hi> Tutors.</p>
               <p>It appears then, that, if we will follow in this Matter <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis</hi> his Rule, we muſt be content to ſtick to <hi>the Generality of the Apoſtles Creed.</hi> For, beſides the Generality of the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf, <hi>the Apoſtles Creed</hi> (which inconteſtably was given for <hi>the Rule of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> as well as for <hi>the Summary of Religion</hi> which every one is oblig'd to <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to underſtand aright</hi> to the beſt of his Power as he ſhall anſwer it to God) is, as to theſe Matters, the only <hi>Standard</hi> which <hi>all Chriſtians have always agreed in.</hi> As Biſhop <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor</hi> obſerves, in his 2d. Sermon. on <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.7. <q>The Catholick Church has been too much and too ſoon divided.—Yet in things ſimply Neceſſary God has preſerved us ſtill unbroken. For <hi>all</hi> Nations and <hi>all</hi> Ages have received <hi>the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Creed.</hi>
                  </q> All Chriſtian People, then, in all Ages, having only agreed, as I ſaid, in <hi>the Generality</hi> (or the Expreſſions themſelves) <hi>of the Apoſtles Creed;</hi> that muſt needs therefore be <hi>ſufficient;</hi> if God has preſerv'd us unbroken in things <hi>ſimply Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi> or if nothing is to be judg'd <hi>abſolutely Neceſſary</hi> but <hi>what all have always agreed in. Quod ubique, quod ſemper, quod ab omnibus.</hi> Is it not indeed ſufficient, to <hi>the great Purpoſes of Chriſtian Religion;</hi> to know, concerning <hi>God,</hi> that He is <hi>All-Wiſe, All-Juſt, All Good, Almighty;</hi> to know, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>his Son,</hi> and the <hi>H. Ghoſt his Spirit,</hi> by way of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; and to know, that <hi>Chriſt died to Redeem us and turn us away from our Sins,</hi> that <hi>it is the H. Spirit of God that Suggeſts good Motions to us,</hi> that <hi>all thoſe Societies where the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt are obſerv'd and celebrated, and where the pure Word of God is Preach'd, are true Parts of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Church,</hi> that <hi>we ſhall all Riſe from the Dead,</hi> and that <hi>God will reward all Men according to their Works?</hi> Is not this, <hi>to know God, and Chriſt?</hi> And <hi>have all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans always agreed in the Super-induced Platoniſm?</hi> Even Monſieur <hi>Jurien</hi> owns, (and indeed who can deny it, that will deal ſincerely, and has inquir'd into the Matter?) that the <hi>Ante-nicene</hi> Fathers held not <hi>the Son's Eternal Perſonality,</hi> nor his <hi>Equality to the Father.</hi> (<hi>Lettr. Paſtor. Vol.</hi> 3. <hi>Let.</hi> 6.) After-Ages then, which broached theſe Tenets, can no more plead <hi>Tradition,</hi> than they can reaſonably be ſuppos'd to have infallibly mended the Primitive Faith. And this leads us to the next thing to be ſpoken to.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>THE prevailing Sentiment of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Doctors is of no weight againſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians.</hi> And that particularly for theſe Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Men that followed the Sentiment then prevailing differed from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin even of the foregoing <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> as well as the rigid <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> as appears from what has been alledged in the laſt Chapter. There we have ſeen, it was the current Opinion of the ancient <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> as well as of the ſtricteſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> not only that the Holy Ghoſt is not God, but alſo that the Son is not <hi>the God that has no other God above him,</hi> has not conſequently the ſame Eſſence with the Father, and is not Eternal and Omniſcient like him. What pretence then can the <hi>Nicene</hi> and <hi>Poſt-Nicene</hi> Doctors, or their Diſciples, have to plead <hi>Antiquity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality,</hi> and to tell Us <hi>that upon that account We ought to ſubmit to their Sentiment?</hi> Some think that the <hi>Nicene Creed</hi> imports very little or no more than <hi>Semi-Arianiſm.</hi> Howbeit, whether or no the <hi>Nicene Platoniſts</hi> went further than the remaining <hi>Ante-Nicene</hi> Writers or than moſt or any of them, it is evident that the <hi>Poſt-Nicene</hi> are gone beyond the <hi>Ante-Nicene</hi> or <hi>Semi-Arians;</hi> and thus 'tis evident the Doctrin is <hi>varied</hi> from that of the <hi>Ante-Nicene Platoniſts,</hi> and conſequently 'tis in vain for the preſent <hi>(Scholaſtick) Trinitarians</hi> to pretend to <hi>Antiquity</hi> or <hi>Tradition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. We plainly ſee what led the generality of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Doctors into farther Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; Namely, the too much leaning to <hi>Plato,</hi> and more and more following, or, as they might imagin, improving, his Conceits, if they went farther than the <hi>Ante Nicene.</hi> Many of the <hi>Ante-Nicene,</hi> for two Ages before, had begun to <hi>Platonize,</hi> as we before obſerved. And what was ſo unhappily begun by the Chriſtian Platoniſts, or Converted Philoſophers, was ſtill (it ſeems) carried to a greater exceſs, in proceſs of time, by the Men in Authority, and their Followers, at leaſt in point of rigidneſs and violence. Howbeit, all the Unſcriptural Niceties and Terms of Art of the ſuppo'd Orthodox are found in the Philoſophy of <hi>Plato,</hi> or it's Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, (which thoſe Fathers profeſſed to admire:) Can we then queſtion from whence they drew 'em? (See <hi>Le Clerc</hi>'s <hi>Life of Euſebius,</hi> p. 69. &amp;c.) Some think it very clear, that the <hi>Semi-Arians</hi> are the true <hi>Platonick Trinitarians.</hi> And ſome eſteem, that <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Orthodoxy</hi> goes yet farther, and that Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s or the <hi>Nicene</hi> or <hi>Post-Nicene</hi> Notions are true <hi>Platoniſm.</hi> Howſoever it be, when Men had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot themſelves, they might eaſily go further.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is notorious, that the moſt part of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Doctors were uncharitable, (and conſequently unchriſtian,) revengeful, violent, and ambitious Prelates, who ſought nothing but to do ſpite to one another, to impoſe imperiouſly upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to put one another out of their Places. Now are not the Deciſions of ſuch Men to be much valued! And are not ſuch Men fit to dictate to others, and to exerciſe Dominion over the Conſcience of their Fellow-Servants! They did ſo much intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37508:27"/>thoſe that followed the ancient Doctrin, and even the Emperor himſelf, that for the moſt part theſe did wretchedly prevaricate. Are thoſe the Ways that Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity preſcribes? Or is not this <hi>the Method to ſuppreſs the Truth,</hi> and maintain what wants good Arguments to ſupport itſelf by?</p>
               <p n="4">4. For the ſame reaſons the Judgment of the <hi>Poſt-Nicene</hi> Fathers is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant. Thoſe whom fallible Men condemn as Hereticks, may be the true Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox; and thoſe who paſs for and ſtile themſelves Orthodox, may be erroneous, and may miſtake in moſt abſtruſe Matters. Howbeit, the <hi>Nicene</hi> Popes, and their Followers, domineering in the Church, as if they had been infallible, got their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations back'd with moſt ſevere Edicts, inſomuch that it was made no leſs than Death but to keep any <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Writings. Thus Chriſtians taught one another Cruelty, and, tho' but juſt eſcaped themſelves out of the Heatheniſh Perſecutions, they inhumanely Perſecuted one another. No wonder then if for the moſt part they led one anther, as Mules are driven with ſtripes; eſpecially conſidering the plauſible Pretence, that this Zeal was for the honour of Chriſtianity. Such Meaſures are rightly expoſed in theſe Words of Dr. <hi>Whichcot.</hi> 
                  <q>All thoſe of a Party are bound to one Opinion, and to believe as their Party believes. Therefore I except againſt thoſe that have blindly gone on without Conſideration. For theſe have not acted by the Guidance of Human Reaſon. <bibl>

Who gave them Authority to decide for other Men, and to lord it over their Faith? What title had they to ſtraiten the Terms of Union, and to exclude out of the Church all that diſſented from them in thoſe at leaſt moſt nice and intricate Speculations? Who commiſſionated them to invent and impoſe, herein, new Words and Deciſions, or new and magiſterial Creeds? Who order'd them to determine Magiſterially to their own Fancies the Generality of the comprehenſive expreſſions of Scripture?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Notwithſtanding the violence of the rigid <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> their novel and unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Deciſions have not been conſtantly and univerſally ſubmitted to, but there are ſtill and there have always been many <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians.</hi> There were many good Biſhops, at and after the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> that could by no means be prevail'd upon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Faith; and their Conſtancy encouraged multitudes of others to adhere to the ancient Doctrin. Not only the generality of Chriſtians even then were ſo far from holding the Holy Ghoſt to be God, that the prevailing <hi>Platoniſts</hi> at <hi>Nice</hi> durſt not determine it; but alſo <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> himſelf once owns that if they of his Party had commonly Preached that Sentiment it would have cauſed confuſion in the Church and ſcandalized good Chriſtians: See <hi>Petav.

(why could they not as well have carried the condeſcenſion one ſtep farther; and then all had been well?) and we ſee <hi>Hilary</hi> calls the Holy Ghoſt but <hi>the Gift,</hi> which he prayes not to, but asks of the Father: But, moreover, maugre the extremeſt Severities procured by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers againſt the <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian.</hi> Then good <hi>Gregory</hi> comforted himſelf, and his few Auditors, with theſe Reflections; <q>
                     <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> have the Churches, but We <hi>Trinitarians</hi> are the Temples of God;

               <p n="8">(8.) <hi>The Prevalency in general of an Opinion is no Argument, that it is agreable to Truth and acceptable to God.</hi> Witneſs the Univerſal Prevalency of <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> of old, and even the great Prevalency of <hi>Mahometiſm.</hi> (Which ſhews that God will try, but not force Men.) If you ask then the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> where are their Churches, and where they were in ſuch or ſuch an Age, they need not reply otherwiſe than by asking again theſe Queſtions, Where were the Churches of the true Religioniſts in the times of <hi>Noah,</hi> of <hi>Thara</hi> and his Son <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Elias,</hi> and of <hi>the general Degeneracy of the Children of Iſrael,</hi> and all the while that the generality of Chriſtians, inconteſtably, and even according to the Sentiment of Proteſtants, were defiled with many Corruptions and Superſtitions and Idolatries? The true and pure Church of God, Proteſtants muſt own, was at thoſe times in a manner Inviſible, ſhut up within the Walls of a few Private Families, exiled out of the Places of great Concourſe, and driven into the Wilderneſs. The People of God then indeed was but a little Flock. And why might it not likewiſe be ſo, when the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> were oppreſſed, were but few in number, and were reduc'd to great extremities? A Thouſand Years in the ſight of God is but as one Day. God may think fit to permit the Wicked and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to perſecute his People for many Days. Hereby he tries his Elect, he puniſhes their Sins, he trains them up for Heaven thro' the ſuffering of Affliction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37508:28"/>he blinds a vicious World, but at laſt he will ſhew that he can draw Light out of Darkneſs, and that the Strength of Hell ſhall not be able to prevail finally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Church, for God in his own time may call her from her Exile, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem her from her Captivity, and make her ſhine as the Sun, and then the Earth ſhall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord as the Waters cover the Sea. And it is certain, there is and can be no Preſcription againſt the Truth.</p>
               <p>The Prevalency then of the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Sentiment, for any of the paſt Ages ſince the Apoſtles, can be no Argument againſt the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians.</hi> We read, in the Second Chapter of <hi>Judges,</hi> at the 7th. 10th 11th. and 12th. Verſes, that <q>the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſerved the Lord all the Days of <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> and all the Days of the Elders who out-lived <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> and who had ſeen all the great Works of the Lord that he did for <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but that, when all that Generation was gathered unto their Fathers, the next Generation knew not the Lord, and the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did evil in the ſight of the Lord,</q> and ſerved other Gods, and provoked the Lord to anger. And why could not a like Defection happen, immediately or ſoon after the Deceaſe of the Apoſtles? Even in the time of the Apoſtles there were Hereſies. And we ſee it is the Complaint of the earlieſt Doctors, that the Apoſtles were no ſooner depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but Chriſtians corrupted themſelves apace. And if it was ſo, that ought after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be no Prejudice againſt the Truth. As Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> well obſerves in his 22d. Sermon. <q>When a Truth returns from Baniſhment by a <hi>Peſtliminium,</hi> if it was from the firſt, tho' the holy Fire has been buried or the River ran under ground, yet we do not call that new; ſince Newneſs is not to be accounted of by a proportion to our ſhort lived Memories, or to the broken Records and Fragments of Story left after the Inundation of Barbariſm and War, and Change of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and Corruption of Authors; but by its relation to the Fountain of our Truths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Thus it is evident that the <hi>Objection</hi> of the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> founded upon the pretended <hi>Antiquity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> of their Sentiment, is abſolutely <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> And <hi>therefore</hi> We muſt <hi>conclude</hi> that Controverſy, with <hi>this</hi> Conſideration; <hi>Viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">(9.) <hi>The only Authority that We can and ought to rely upon, is that of the Bible.</hi> As Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> excellently well ſays, the BIBLE only is the Religion of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi> I ſee plainly, ſays he, Fathers againſt Fathers, Popes againſt Popes, the ſame Fathers againſt themſelves, Councils againſt Councils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What Method then to judge of the Truth can We take, but that which even St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> propoſes? <hi>Contr. Maxim. L.</hi> 3. <hi>C.</hi> 14. <q>We ought not, ſays he, to object to one another either the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> or that of <hi>Rimini,</hi> but We are to conſider the Matter by the <hi>Scripture</hi> it ſelf.</q> 
                  <hi>Dalaeus</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his firſt Book <hi>De uſu Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum</hi> quotes a Paſſage out of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> importing, that when the Channels or Streams of the Eccleſiaſtical Tradition ſeem confuſe, or broken and corrupted, we muſt have recourſe to the Spring or Fountain's Head. Every Mans Reaſon, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders, will tell him, that there are no other Meaſures then to be taken, there being no later Preſcription to be taken againſt the Truth. And God himſelf expreſly ſends us thither. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.20. <hi>To the Law, or the (Divine) Teſtimony: If they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</hi> But as for <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> it is evident that no ſtreſs can be laid on their Authority; for, as the learned <hi>Daleus</hi> ſhews in his Book <hi>of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of the Fathers,</hi> they all had Errors, and differed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37508:29"/>from one another in ſeveral weighty Particulars, and often differed from their own ſelves, being unſetled and inconſtant in their Notions, not knowing their own Mind, one day holding one thing, and another time aſſerting the contrary. This may be a Sign, that they ſearched after the Truth, like other Men, as well as they could; (which is very commendable, and is every ones indiſpenſible Duty:) But it is not the Character of thoſe, who are infallible, and who muſt implicitely and abſolately be followed as our Rule.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>A Second (General) Objection, against the</hi> Unitarian <hi>Syſtem, Anſwered.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE next <hi>Objection,</hi> on which the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> commonly lay great ſtreſs, is, <hi>That the Work of Redemption, and what the Scripture aſcribes to our Saviour, is above the Capacity of a Man, it being impoſſible for a Creature, to become the Object of Worſhip and hear the Prayers of Men, to make Satisfaction for Sins or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile God to theſe that have forfeited his Favour, to know the Hearts, to forgive Sins, to govern the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, to raiſe the Dead, to judge the World, and do whatſoever the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>anſwering</hi> this, this Reflection cannot but be premiſed; that it is lamentable, Men are uſually ſo careleſs as not to inform themſelves rightly of the Sentiment of thoſe whom they condemn, or are ſo unſincere as not fairly to repreſent it. But moſt certainly this is the Caſe here. As for my part, I abſolutely take party neither with the <hi>Socinians</hi> nor with the <hi>Arians,</hi> but think it preſumptuous to determine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly a Myſtery which the Scripture has left in a great Generality. Howbeit, I ſee plainly, and am fully perſuaded, that the preſent <hi>Objection</hi> is wholly groundleſs, and doth not in the leaſt invalidate either of thoſe Syſtems; for it is founded on an (either wilfully or otherwiſe) erroneous and miſtaken Suppoſition, as if the <hi>Arians</hi> or <hi>Socinians</hi> held our Saviour to be a mere Creature, or a mere Man. Surely it is a Point of Juſtice, and a Duty of Chriſtian Charity, not to miſrepreſent the Cauſe of any Party, but to endeavour to take it in the beſt Senſe, and put upon it the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableſt Conſtruction poſſible. But the quite contrary is done in this <hi>Objection.</hi> The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> therefore <hi>anſwer</hi> it thus.</p>
               <p>According to our Sentiment, Chriſt, in the buſineſs of Salvation or Redemption, is not left to work with the bare Strength and Capacity of a Man, but is commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated of God and by him conſtituted in Authority, conſtantly enlightened and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the Holy Spirit, and directed and aſſiſted by the Divine Wiſdom and Power dwelling in him. For we hold, agreably to the Scripture, that (the Father aſſiſting, acting and dwelling in his Son, by his Inſpiration and the Influences of his Power and Wiſdom,) the Fulneſs of the God-head, inhabiting in him, by its conſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37508:29"/>enables him to perform all that he is appointed to do. <hi>Chriſt</hi> therefore, in the Execution of his Office, is <hi>not to be conſidered as a mere Creature,</hi> but <hi>as a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in and by which God works, and which acts for God, and moſt eminently repreſents God, and is moſt intimately poſſible one with God.</hi> There is no <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> but holds all this; believing that by the ſaid Means there is as ſtrict an Union betwixt the God-head and Chriſt as there can be betwixt God and a Creature. This is particularly what the <hi>Arians</hi> mean, in giving the title of God to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially is what the <hi>Socinians</hi> intimate, by their ſeemingly ſtrange Saying, that Chriſt was made God, <hi>Homo Deus factus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What Advantage then over the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> have the <hi>Trinitarians.</hi> by their Notion of the Incarnation of a ſuppoſed Second Divine Perſon? Can any thing be done by a Man ſuppoſed Hypoſtatically or Perſonally United with a Second Divine Perſon, that cannot be performed by a Man in whom the Fulneſs of the God-head dwells in the manner aforeſaid? Since it is the God-head, dwelling in Chriſt, that doth the Marvellous Works, can he not do whatſoever God pleaſes, and whatſoever God can do?</p>
               <p>And indeed what can the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> mean by their Term of the <hi>Hypoſtatical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of a Divine Perſon with Chriſt's Human Nature, but <hi>this In-dwelling</hi> of the God-head in the Man Chriſt Jeſus? Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> at the 210th. and 211th. Pages of his Anſwer to the Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter</hi>'s Book, gives the true Deſcription of the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Notion of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> in theſe Words. <hi>The perfect Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Saviour was not mere Human Nature, tho' as innocent and perfect as Human Nature can be in this World; but the Divinity dwelling and acting in Human Nature, influencing and guiding all its Motions, as the Soul governs the Body; for this is a true Notion of a God Incarnate, that God lives and acts in Human Nature, and is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of all its Actions and Motions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is there any thing here that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> do not hold? Do they aſſert, that Chriſt did any thing without the Divine Motions, or without God's Guidance and Acting in him? They firmly believe, that the Man Chriſt Jeſus readily and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly aſſented to the whole Will of God, and that God conſtantly aſſiſted him, and thus wrought in and by him all the Super-natural Works that Chriſt did.</p>
               <p>What colour of reaſon then have the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> to pretend, that the Work of Redemption ſurpaſſes the Capacity which the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> aſcribe to Chriſt? It is plain, that, ſince the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> aſſert that God conſtantly influences and guides, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts and acts in and by Chriſt, (which it ſeems is the Summ of what the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> themſelves hold, which expreſly is all that the Scripture teaches of the Union between God and Chriſt, and which moſt certainly ſuffices to impower Chriſt to do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever God can do,) the Diſpute and Quarrel here of the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> with the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> is altogether groundleſs and unwarrantable. We have all the reaſon imaginable to love God with all our Soul, and to be eternally thankful to his Divine Majeſty, for thus addreſſing himſelf to us miſerable Sinners, wonderfully ſpeaking and acting in and by his Son Chriſt Jeſus to reconcile the World unto himſelf, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling him to Save to the uttermoſt all thoſe that come to God thro' him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:37508:30"/>As was ſaid, this is all that the Scripture expreſly teaches us concerning this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Scripture repreſents God doing all things for Chriſt, upon his requeſt. The <hi>Trinitarians</hi> therefore cannot juſtly find fault with the Doctrin of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> concerning our Saviour's Perſon. But the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> are bound, to reject what the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> add thereto not only without expreſs Authority of Scripture but contrary to the cleareſt Light of Scripture and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Altho' God by the Influence of his Divine Wiſdom and Power dwells in Chriſt, and is repreſented as conſtantly aſſiſting him and acting in and by him, yet the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture no where ſays that God (or the Father) and Chriſt make but one Perſon. It cannot be imagined, and the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> themſelves do not aſſert, that by God's dwelling in Chriſt is meant any more than God's conſtant guiding and aſſiſting him. Now it no way follows, that becauſe a Son willeth all that his Father willeth, and the Father conſtantly guides and aſſiſts his Son, therefore the Father and the Son are but one Perſon. But it is evident, that, the Father being an intelligent Being, and the Son a diſtinſt intelligent Being from the Father, the Father and the Son muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be two Perſons. For a Spirit, as long as he exiſts, cannot but have always in himſelf, diſtinctly from all other Spirits, what conſtitutes a Perſon, and can ſay ſome things of himſelf diſtinctly from others. Thus, how ſtrictly ſoever God and Chriſt be U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, Chriſt can ſay of himſelf that <hi>he</hi> is a Creature ſo many Ages Old, &amp; God can ſay that <hi>he</hi> is Self exiſtent and never had a Beginning. Now here are two <hi>he</hi>'s, or two <hi>l</hi>'s, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently 2 <hi>Perſons,</hi> for theſe are <hi>Perſonal Pronouns,</hi> &amp; each of them denotes a diſtinct Perſon.</p>
               <p>And the Scripture is ſo far from aſſerting God and Chriſt to be one Perſon, that it conſtantly <hi>diſtinguiſhes</hi> Chriſt from God. Indeed, in the Scripture-ſtile, a ſpecial Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and Repreſentative may beare the Name of him whom he moſt eſpecially acts for and repreſents. And Chriſt may moreover be termed a God in an Inferior Senſe, as Kings and Princes are called Gods in Scripture. He may alſo be called God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as a Divine Influence moſt intimately dwells in him. But the Scripture not only no where ſays that Chriſt <hi>is literally</hi> the ſame God with the eternal God, (or is the Whole of the Father,) but it teaches the contrary. For it all along repreſents Chriſt as a Man in whom God dwells, and whom God exalts to the higheſt Dignity over all other Creatures. And Chriſt himſelf expreſly ſays, that the <hi>Father</hi> is <hi>greater</hi> than <hi>be.</hi> Which manifeſtly imports, that tho' God dwels and acts in him, yet God is <hi>diſtinct</hi> from him, and ſtill keeps the Supreme Authority to himſelf, reſerving to himſelf the Power to act in him when or ſo far as he pleaſes, for he was not pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for inſtance, to enable him to diſpoſe wholly of the Gifts of the Spirit till after his Aſcenſion, and he had not revealed to him when ſhould be the Day of Judgment, but kept to himſelf the Times and Seaſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thereby then it appears, that Chriſt is but a Man acting for God, and to that end aſſiſted of God, as was ſaid; tho' the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> generally will not allow him to be truly a Man, but only a Human Nature, which is but an imaginary Shadow of a Man. When they call him <hi>God-Man,</hi> they mean only a Divine Perſon united with their General Conception of a Human Nature that has no real Subſiſtence, which is not truly a Man. For, as the Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> excellently well obſerves, (<hi>p.</hi> 63d. of his <hi>Reflections upon the late Examination of the Diſcourſe of the Deſcent of the Man Christ Jeſus from Heaven,</hi>) <q>to ſay that <hi>the Man Jeſus</hi> has no <hi>Subſiſtence of his own,</hi> is to ſay that he has no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37508:30"/>Subſiſtence than an Accident has in union with the Subſtance to which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs; and this makes him inferior to any Man God ever made.</q> Nay, this actually unmans him. (Therefore the Biſhop rightly calls this monſtrous Doctrine <hi>Scholaſtick Gibberiſh.</hi>) Whereas the Scripture not only never calls Chriſt a <hi>God Man,</hi> but in a great many places calls him <hi>a Man,</hi> (<hi>John</hi> 8.40. <hi>John</hi> 1.30. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and expreſly ſays, that, as to his Perſon and Human Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, he was <hi>in all things like unto us, Sin excepted.</hi> (<hi>Hebr.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21.) Now if he be <hi>a Man</hi> he has a Subſiſtence of his own, for ſo has <hi>a Man;</hi> and if he has a Subſiſtence of his own, he cannot be ſuppoſed to be united to the Godhead, and to be a God, but as the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> hold he is, Namely, inaſmuch as God conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guides him and acts in and by him in the High Station in which He has placed him, (which, after all, the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> as we have ſeen, own is all they mean by the Incarnation or Perſonal Union;) and ſo it is moſt inconteſtably evident, that notwithſtanding the Difference that the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> make between Them and the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians,</hi> they can give no reaſon for their pretence, that according to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Syſtem</hi> the Lord Jeſus is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncapacitated</hi> for the Work of Redemption. And if he were <hi>So</hi> according to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian,</hi> from what has been ſaid it manifeſtly appears he ſhould as much be <hi>So</hi> according to the <hi>Trinitarian Scheme.</hi> For both found his <hi>Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> upon the <hi>In-dwelling</hi> or <hi>Aſſiſting Godhead</hi> in him.</p>
               <p>To this the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> reply, that except the Godhead and the Man Jeſus Chriſt were ſuppoſed to make but one Perſon, Chriſt could not be ſaid, as be is, to do thoſe things, which none but the Divine Power doth. Therefore it muſt be infer'd, that this one Perſon, Chriſt, is <hi>God-Man,</hi> and implies a Divine and a Human Nature Perſonally-united together. For the Scripture attributes the Miracles of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to his own inherent Power, and his Revelations and Propheſies to his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Knowledg. For it is ſaid, that he knew what was in Man, that he rebuked the Wind and the Sea, that he will raiſe the Dead at the laſt Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this Plea the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> anſwer, that, by the ſame reaſoning, when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour promiſed his Diſciples (<hi>John</hi> 14.12,) that <hi>They</hi> ſhould <hi>Do</hi> greater Works than thoſe he had done, the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> cannot avoid concluding, that they ſhould do thoſe Miracles by their own Power, and that they ſhould then be conſidered as indeed Perſonally-united with the Godhead. But cannot the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Men may be ſaid to do thoſe things, which are effected by the Means and Helps which they make uſe and can diſpoſe of? Is not a General ſaid to take a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which his Army ſtorms at his Orders? Is not a Phyſician ſaid to do a Cure, that is effected, with God's Bleſſing, by the Remedy he has preſcrib'd? In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may not Men be ſaid to do thoſe things, which are wrought by the Power, which God has inveſted them with, or granted them the diſpoſal of? To come then to the objected Particulars.</p>
               <p>Chriſt <hi>works Miracles, raiſes the Dead, forgives Sins,</hi> and <hi>doth whatſoever the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does,</hi> by deſiring God to do theſe things, at his requeſt, which the Father al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth him to ask and to expect of him. Therefore, all things whatſoever, that he ſees or knows the Father doth or can do, and that are requiſite to the fulfilling the Work of Salvation, Chriſt begs the Father to do them, and, the Father doing them at this his moſt beloved Son's Interceſſion, Chriſt is cenſed or reckoned to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:37508:31"/>do them. The way that all Intelligent Beings <hi>Do</hi> thoſe Things that God has put in their Power, is by <hi>Willing</hi> them, and <hi>

Now, it ſeems, all <hi>the Means</hi> which God has appointed <hi>for Chriſt to do whatſoever the Father doth,</hi> is <hi>to know</hi> them, to know the Father will do them for him, <hi>and to deſire them of the Father.</hi> For tho' it be ſaid, that Chriſt did and is to do moſt wonderful Works, yet the Scripture is very far from ſaying that he doth them <hi>of Himſelf,</hi> or by his own Power.

                  </gap>0. <hi>The Father that dwelleth in me, He doth the Works.</hi> Matth. 12.28. <hi>I caſt out Devils by the Spirit of God.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> 11.41, 42. <hi>Father, I thank thee that thou Heareſt me always.</hi> How could Chriſt have declared more expreſly, that he doth <hi>not</hi> the Supernatural Works <hi>by his own Power,</hi> but by <hi>the Means</hi> which have been ſaid, Namely, <hi>By</hi> knowing that the Father will do them for him, and <hi>By</hi> deſiring the Father to do them by his Divine Power and by what Means He pleaſes to uſe? Seeing that the Father has promiſed our Saviour <hi>to hear him always,</hi> he may truly ſay, that all things which the Father has are his. And therefore it is certain, that not only there never was ſuch another Prophet as Chriſt, but alſo that he is the moſt Excellent and moſt Dignified Creature that can be. But yet, we ſee, it doth not follow, that, becauſe he doth what none but God can do, he is therefore hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatically united with a Divine Perſon, and, that, diſtinct from the Father. The Scripture ſhews us, How Chriſt doth all Supernatural Things; he himſelf tells us, he deſires the Father to do them, and the Father always grants his requeſts, and doth what he deſires; and he deſires nothing but what he knows the Father will grant; and the Father has promis'd, and conſtantly gives him, whatſoever is neceſſary for the Diſcharge of his Office.</p>
               <p>Chriſt then may truly ſay, that as the Father has Life in himſelf, or at his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, ſo has he given to the Son to have Life in himſelf. For as the Father doth all things by <hi>Willing them,</hi> ſo Chriſt doth all things by <hi>Deſiring</hi> them. As God has put Power in the Natural Sun, to vivify all Seeds in the Earth; ſo he has, in an infinitely more excellent way, inveſted Chriſt, the Sun of Righteouſneſs, with Power to quicken the Dead. But ſtill the Power of the Lord Jeſus is <hi>the Divine Power.</hi> And we ſee, that, as we have ſaid, God makes Chriſt to be Partaker there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So that as the Father has <hi>Divine Power</hi> in him; ſo has <hi>He</hi> given to the Son to have <hi>Divine Power</hi> in him; inſomuch, that when the Father has ſhewn him a Miraculous Thing, the Son can do the ſame likewiſe, by the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power,</hi> which dwells in him, and which he conſtantly has the uſe of, by <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Asking,</hi> or affectionately <hi>Deſiring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus; Chriſt <hi>knows the Hearts,</hi> by the ſame Means; by <hi>the Divine Power</hi> that is in him, or annexed to him, and that reveals them to him. (See <hi>the Brief Hiſtory of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> on <hi>John</hi> 2.25. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.23.) So that; as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſays, at the top of the 196th Page of his laſt Book; <hi>the Knowledg of Chriſt is from the Father's dwelling in him.</hi> And by that Means, Chriſt <hi>Governs the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> and will <hi>Judge the World.</hi>

                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:37508:31"/>As to Chriſt's <hi>Efficacy in obtaining Forgiveneſs</hi> for all thoſe Sinners, whom he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades and excites to forſake their Sins and to become Obedient and New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; it is the ſtrangeſt thing in the World to imagin, that God cannot grant that (which is altogether agreable to the Propenſions of his own Nature) to his moſt beloved Son, even upon that Act and Submiſſion of his, which argues the moſt perfect Obedience, and makes the moſt ſolemn Reparation to the Divine Juſtice and Authority.</p>
               <p>As Dr. <hi>Whichcot</hi> expreſſes himſelf upon this Subject, <hi>Pages</hi> 62 <hi>d</hi> and 63 <hi>d</hi> of his <hi>Select Sermons;</hi> 
                  <q>We are in the hands of him that is Primarily and Originally Good: And He will certainly commiſerate every Caſe, ſo far as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionable. Now the Caſe of a Sinner is compaſſionable, if he be Penitent.</q> God might then ſurely accept of Chriſt's Sacrifice as as ſufficient Attonement, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it ſo fully confirms God's Hatred to Sin and his Good Will to thoſe that Obey him, and is conſequently the powerfulleſt Motive and the likelieſt Means to engage thoſe for whom that Sacrifice is offered, and who are not yet incorrigible, to forſake their evil Ways, to accept the Offers of Grace, and to be reconciled to God. Chriſt's Death is the fulleſt Confirmation of God's Good Will to thoſe that obey him, ſeeing that upon the account of his Son's perfect Obedience He has exalted him to the higheſt Glory, even of being Partaker of the Divine Nature and Power. And it is alſo the fulleſt Confirmation of God's abſolute Hatred to Sin, ſeeing He would not pardon the Sins of Men without this Conſideration &amp; Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he, who was Innocent &amp; the moſt Perfect &amp; Excellent Creature, &amp; pleaded for the Fallen Race of Mankind ſhould, as their Advocate, ſuffer in their ſtead, expiate their Sins with his Blood, and thus exhibit a moſt ſolemn Demonſtration of the Demerit of Sin. But this no where is repreſented in Scripture as a perfectly equivalent Satisfaction in the moſt rigorous ſenſe. And neither Scripture nor Reaſon ſhew, that God can Pardon but upon ſuch Terms. (See the aforeſaid <hi>Sermons of Dr. Whichcot,</hi> Pag. 301, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> on <hi>Act.</hi> 13.38.)</p>
               <p>As the Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> obſerves, at the 85th and following Pages of his afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Reflections on the Book of Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> againſt him; <q>Chriſt's meriting of God the Father cannot be underſtood in the higheſt ſenſe of meriting, as we may merit of one another; that is, by doing acts of Kindneſs and Beneficeace from mere Good Will, or no antecedent Obligation to the Perſon to whom the Kindneſs is ſhewn. 'Tis nothing but the wretched Popiſh Doctrin of Merit, that has made it an offenſive word in relation to God. But taking <hi>Meritum</hi> and <hi>Mereri</hi> in the Fathers ſenſe, there is no offence to be taken at it, as reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God: For they meant no more than having a right to be rewarded by him, from the performance of that Obedience or Service to which he has annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reward by a moſt gracious Promiſe. But as it is impoſſible to do God Almighty a Kindneſs or Benefit, ſo I cannot underſtand how the Son of God himſelf could, in this ſenſe, merit of his Father the Redemption of Mankind: ſince he did or ſuffered, by vertue of the Union, nothing but what the Will of his Father obliged him unto. <hi>Lo, I come,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to do thy Will, O God.</hi> And his perfectly complying with this Will, was his meriting our Redemption of his Father, as He willed to make him the Author thereof upon that Condition.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:37508:32"/>And therefore Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> ſays well, <hi>Totum Meritum Chriſti pendet à Voluntate Divina.</hi>
                  </q> Now, will any Man ſay, that Chriſt, as Man, did not <hi>thus</hi> merit?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Then by the moſt wonderful Submiſſion and Self-Reſignation of the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who was moſt Innocent, to the dreadful and undeſerved Death of the Croſs, God's abſolute Authority over his Creatures was moſt highly vindicated, after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and his apoſtate Off-ſpring had wofully eclipſed the Glory of his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Authority of his Laws. This <hi>Second Adam,</hi> by the ſinleſs and moſt perfect Obedience of his Life, was an high Vindicator thereof; but his enduring moſt inexpreſſible Torments, (which he did as Man,) and dying the moſt curſed Death of the Croſs, as our Sacrifice, did God the Father as high Honor, in the Face of the Sun, as all the Sins of Mankind, put together, could do him Diſhonor. And by this means this Sacrifice became Satisfactory, ſo as that God would, for the ſake thereof, grant Terms of Pardon and Reconciliation to Fallen Mankind, ſince He now ſaw it moſt agreable to all his Attributes to do ſo.</q> Thus far this Learned Prelate.</p>

                  <p>THERE <hi>remains</hi> but one <hi>Article</hi> to be here <hi>conſidered,</hi> to give a particular and full Anſwer to every Branch of the <hi>Objection</hi> mention'd in the beginning of this Chapter. <hi>It</hi> is this; <q>that, according to the Ideas which the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Syſtem gives of Chriſt, it ſeems, he cannot be ſuppoſed to be able to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37508:32"/>hear the Prayers of Men, or to be a proper Object of Worſhip.</q> But this will particularly appear to be a groundleſs and unneceſſary piece of Wrangling, if theſe Conſiderations be duely weighed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There are divers Kinds of Worſhip, according to the Nature of the Subject to whom it is to be paid. (See <hi>Grotius</hi> on <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.10.) All that the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> can aſcribe to Chriſt, in following the Scripture, conſiſts in reverencing him, to the Honour of the Father, as the Mediator of the New Covenant, and, under God, the Univerſal Monarch, acting for the Father, in whom the Father dwells, whom the Father moſt extraordinarily aſſiſts with his Divine Wiſdom and Power, to enable him, in his Mediatory Kingdom, to govern the Univerſe and ſave to the uttermoſt thoſe that come to God thro' him, and with whom conſequently the Divine Nature is as intimately United as poſſible. (The <hi>Trinitarians</hi> acknowledge, that the whole Perſon of Chriſt is the Mediator of the New Covenant, and conſequently it ſeems inconteſtable that the whole Perſon of Chriſt is to be honoured as Mediator, or with Mediatory and Subordinate Honour, having receiv'd Kingdom, Power, and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, from the Father, and acting for the Father.) Now thus, and according to all theſe and the like reſpects, the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> worſhip the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; even as one who is appointed to be honoured to the Glory of the Father, as one who is exalted to the higheſt Dignity in the Univerſe, and as one with whom the Divine Nature is as intimately united as poſſible, ſo as that he is inlightned with the Divine Wiſdom, and he diſpoſes of the Divine Power and Inſpiration, as of his own, it being made his, by his Union to the Divine Nature, and by the Father his dwelling in him, or by the Divine Aſſiſtance and Inſpiration without meaſure attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, always conducting and illuminating him, and thereby exalting his Spirit to the higheſt Pitch of Grandeur, Wiſdom, and Power, and making him in the moſt eminent manner poſſible one with God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> thus holding the Lord Jeſus Chriſt United and Aſſiſted with the Divine Nature, the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> cannot juſtly pretend, that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Syſtem repreſents him as unable to perform any thing, which by the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Notion of the Incarnation he may be ſuppos'd to be capable of; ſeeing the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> hold, that he, without meaſure, (according to the Scripture Phraſe,) is illuminated with the Divine Wiſdom, and diſpoſes of and is aſſiſted by and enjoys the Divine Power as his own: ſo that he may hear Men, and ſuccor them. It appears nevertheleſs, as was ſaid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtable, that (his Kingdom, as was obſerved, being but a Mediatory Kingdom, or his Reign being but a Government under God, ſubject to and directed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that the Father is ſtill to be conſidered not barely as jointly ruling, but as literally the Supreme Ruler) the Lord Jeſus Chriſt cannot reaſonably be addreſſed to but as Mediator, or as the Vicegerent of the Univerſe, and conſequently is to be worſhipped but with a Mediatory or a Subordinate Worſhip. Wherefore the Body of the Prayers ought not to be addreſſed to him, (as they are in the Litany;) but the Father generally is to be Pray'd to, in the Name or thro' the Mediation of the Son: And ſome Ejaculations, and (particularly at the end or beginning of the Service) a ſhort Addreſs may be offered to the Son, to beſeech him, to Intercede for us, to have Mercy upon us, and to aſſiſt us with his Grace. And according to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Syſtem the Lord Jeſus Chriſt can be thus addreſſed to and worſhipped. This Subject,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37508:33"/>concerning <hi>the Worſhip of Chriſt as Mediator,</hi> (or <hi>as a Man exalted</hi> to the High Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor with which it has pleaſed God to dignify him,) is fully treated of by <hi>Limborch,</hi> in his <hi>Theologia Chriſtiana, Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Cap.</hi> 18. The Author of the <hi>Humble Inquiry,</hi> at P. 15th. &amp; 16th. of that Book, obſerves, this Doctrin, concerning Chriſt's Human Nature being capable, to know what paſſes upon Earth, and ſo to ſee and hear and aſſiſt Men, is ſo far from being (with any juſtice or reaſon) to be by the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> objected to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Syſtem, that the greateſt part and the moſt Learned of the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> agree with <hi>Socinus</hi> in this Point. For the School-Men, both <hi>Thomiſts</hi> and <hi>Scotiſts,</hi> and the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> generally, aſcribe <hi>this</hi> Univerſal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the Man Jeſus Chriſt. And of the Modern <hi>Reformed Divines,</hi> that Author quotes Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> together with a worthy Divine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> who wrote a Book called <hi>The Good Samaritan,</hi> aſſerting, <q>that an Angel might be capable of Ruling the Univerſal Church on Earth;</q> [now a Human Soul in a groſs and fleſhy Body is an Angel ſhackled, and ſtraitned in a dark and cloſe Dungeon, where he cannot exert his Powers and Faculties, no more than an Infant can reaſon like a Philoſopher, but the Impediments being remov'd a Human Spirit is (wiſe &amp; free &amp; powerful) like an Angel, &amp; knows as he is known, &amp; perhaps can direct the Courſe of the Sun, or move the Globe of the Earth, as eaſily as a Child can a <hi>Tennis-Ball;</hi>] <q>that the Man Jeſus Chriſt as eaſily inſpects the whole Earth as we can view a Globe of an Inch Diameter; that he Intercedes particularly as Man and cannot be thought to Intercede in a Caſe if he do not know it; that the Human Underſtanding of Chriſt takes in all Occurrences which concern his Church; that like the Sun-Beams He pierces into every corner; and that as a Looking-Glaſs wrought in the form of a Globe repreſents the Images of all that is in the Room, ſo the enlarged Human Underſtanding of Chriſt takes in all things in Earth at once.</q> (The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> would only add, that Chriſt doth this, by the Affiſtance of the Divine Nature, dwelling in him, and both enlarging and inlightning his Underſtanding. And indeed if Chriſt acting in God's ſtead at the Head of the Univerſe repreſented not God, to the Glory and Service of God, and by God's Appointment, and if the Divine Nature, the Divine Knowledge, Power and Authority, dwelled not in the Man Jeſus Chriſt, as the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> hold; their Worſhip of him would be a kind of Idolatry: That is to ſay; if the Father, by his own Appointment, was not worſhipped in Chriſt, in whom inconteſtably He moſt eminently dwells; or, which is the ſame, if Chriſt was not appointed by God, to be worſhipped, to the Glory of the Father; to which end it is neceſſary, that the Father ſhould make him partaker of his Nature and Power, as has been ſaid; for tho' the Foreknowledge of Chriſt be not Univerſal, and tho' at ſometimes he feels greater Influences of the God-head dwelling in him than at ſome other times, yet he muſt always receive ſufficient Influences thereof to enable him to diſcharge the Parts of his Mediatory Kingdom; and the God-head, by a Divine Power, which is an Influence of the Father's, muſt conſtantly refide in and be as intimately as poſſible United with Chriſt, to make him the moſt eminent Divine <hi>Schechina,</hi> and to capacitate him to repreſent, as he doth, and act for, the Father, at the Helm of Government over all things, ſo that, being ſuch a Repreſentative of God as neither is nor ever was the like beſides Him, He truly exhibits God, and the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37508:33"/>Divine Majeſty, dwelling in him in a moſt extraordinary manner.) In a word, We hold that no other is <hi>of himſelf God,</hi> or <hi>properly and eminently God,</hi> Eternal and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, but <hi>the Father.</hi> And we own no other for <hi>Inferior Gods,</hi> but ſuch as are <hi>truly</hi> ſo, according to <hi>the Divine Order and Appointment:</hi> And we <hi>honour</hi> them <hi>accordingly.</hi> But <hi>God only</hi> We worſhip with <hi>properly Divine Worſhip.</hi> Howbeit, We worſhip God <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>relatively</hi> in the Perſon of <hi>his Repreſentative,</hi> and <hi>Chief Officer,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, who, <hi>under God,</hi> is <hi>the Soveraign Prince,</hi> and <hi>Great Lord,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal King,</hi> who <hi>acts most eminently for God,</hi> that God may be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in him, and who <hi>is appointed thereto,</hi> to be <hi>honoured,</hi> and <hi>bowed to,</hi> or <hi>worſhipped, to the Glory of God.</hi> And ſo we may truly and allowably worſhip God, <hi>immediately in his own Perſon,</hi> and <hi>mediately in the Perſon of his Lieutenant and moſt eminent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative appointed thereunto, that God may be worſhipped in him, in the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Honour that is paid him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> unanimouſly hold, that indeed we conſtantly are to bow the knee to and worſhip the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in offering our Petitions to the Father in his Name and thro' his Mediation, but that it is not neceſſary to addreſs our ſelves otherwiſe than thus to him, and that <hi>this is</hi> ſufficiently <hi>to call upon his Name in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> And in the moſt ancient Lyturgies extant, there are but very few words ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to Chriſt. Which ſhews, that originally Chriſtians addreſſed the current of their Prayers to the Father: excepting when, in a Viſion, they ſaw the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and heard him ſpeak to them; which St. <hi>Paul</hi> acquaints us happened to him once in the Temple, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.8.9.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It cannot indeed, reaſonably, be denied, but that, when <hi>God</hi> in general is <hi>Pray'd to,</hi> and theſe Prayers are put up <hi>in the Name of Chriſt;</hi> then, both, the Mediatory Honour due to our Saviour is thereby paid him, and all is Supremely Worſhipped that is to be Adored with Supreme or Direct and Ultimate Worſhip. Our Lord aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures his Diſciples, that whatſoever they ſhall <hi>ask the Father in his Name,</hi> the Father will give it them. <hi>John,</hi> 16.23. No more then can be abſolutely needful. In a word, <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> honour the God-head above all things, and the Man Jeſus Chriſt above all other Creatures. What can <hi>the Trinitarians</hi> do more? Or what can they in <hi>this Worſhip</hi> juſtly reprehend? Both <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>the Holy Ghoſt</hi> will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what <hi>the Father</hi> willeth, and <hi>they</hi> will all that the <hi>Father</hi> wills: Manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therefore it is ſufficient to addreſs to <hi>the Father;</hi> the Government of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is but one Government; tho' <hi>God</hi> be the Supreme, and tho' Chriſt have a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty over all Creatures, yet, conſidering the Subordination and Good Order, and conſidering the perfect Agreement of their Wills and Affections, there is as it were but One Soveraign; but <hi>the Father</hi> is alone in himſelf the One only true So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, the Soveraign properly and eminently; all own He ſuſtains the Chiefeſt Part in the Supreme Majeſty, Authority and Government.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> their too much leaning to Human Reaſon is the Cauſe of their Error, wherefore they ſhould conſider, that Reaſon, tho' an excellent Light and Guide ſo far as its Province and Capacity extends, is, in ſome moſt ſublime Points, ſhort-ſighted and blind, and conſequently an incompetent Judge; then they might diſcern, that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Interpretations, beſides that they imply moſt unlikely Aſſertions, are forced and unnatural, and ſo remote from the obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Import of the Words, that 'tis not to be conceived the generality of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, when they read the Scripture, can find out ſuch Interpretations, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin that it is to be underſtood in that Senſe, and therefore it is incredible that that is the true Meaning thereof; moreover, in oppoſition to all Reaſonings, it is to be obſerved, that there are many Texts of Scripture, which make up a ſtrong Evidence of the truth of the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Sentiment, whereas, in fine, the Texts that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> alledge ſeem not expreſs and poſitive for their Syſtem.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe things are put together in one <hi>Objection,</hi> becauſe they depend of or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſupport one another; the Intendment of the Argument being to convince the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> that <hi>they hearken too much to Reaſon and too little to Scripture.</hi> This <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> then is properly made up of theſe <hi>Four Branches,</hi> which if the Reader pleaſes he may conſider as ſo many diſtinct Objections, and which are ſo conſiderable that they very much deſerve to be illuſtrated and carefully weighed, to underſtand the utmoſt force of them.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>That Reaſon, tho' an excellent Light and Guide ſo far as its Province and Capacity reaches, is, in ſeveral myſterious Inſtances, ſhort-ſighted and blind, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently an incompetent Judge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Interpretations imply ſome moſt unlikely Aſſertions, and are, beſides that, forced and unnatural, and ſo remote from the obvious Import of the Words that 'tis not to be conceived the generality of Chriſtians can underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that Senſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>That there are many Texts of Scripture, which, even taken aſunder, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially being put together, make up a ſtrong Evidence for the Trinitarian Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>That the Texts, which the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians alledge, ſeem not expreſs and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for their Syſtem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>That Reaſon, tho' an excellent Light and Guide ſo far as its Province and Capacity reaches, is, in ſeveral myſterious Inſtances, ſhort-ſighted and blind, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently an incompetent Judge.</hi> The generality of Men attribute either too little or
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:37508:34"/>too much to Reaſon. Howbeit, if things be calmly and very carefully conſidered, it will be found that We ought to keep to a Mean betwixt theſe two Extremes.</p>
               <p>Reaſon is to the Mind, what the Eyes are to the Body. None but the Blind can think that the Eyes are of no uſe to judge of Material Objects. Nevertheleſs, if we ſhould take no other Counſel but that of our Eyes, we could not avoid the being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſeveral Inſtances.</p>
               <p>The ſame muſt be ſaid of Reaſon. Undoubtedly it is a noble and excellent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. By a right uſe of it, We may credibly demonſtrate the Being of a God, the Duties of Holineſs and Vertue, the Futurity of Reward and Puniſhment, and all the eternal Truths of Natural Religion.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all this, it is certain thoſe have not thorowly conſidered the moſt obvious things, who do not diſcern, that in many Caſes Reaſon is not only at a loſs, but directly leads us to Error, actually repreſenting to us ſeveral things as falſe, contradictory and impoſſible, which yet we may be ſure are not ſuch.</p>
               <p>We ſee then by experience, that there can be nothing more unreaſonable and unſafe than this Reſolution, To believe Reaſon in nothing or to believe it in all things.</p>
               <p>If we were to truſt our Eyes at all times or elſe at no time at all, We muſt be forced to deny our being ſenſible that the Sun Shines when in its greateſt Splendor, or We muſt be confident that all Sticks are Crooked when part in Water, as they ſeem then to be, and that all Towers are Round, becauſe they appear ſo, at a certain diſtance.</p>
               <p>Every Man knows, that there are ſome Means, to be aſſured when We ought, and when We ought not to credit our Eyes. In like manner, it cannot be doubted but that there are ſome Rules, whereby, if We carefully attend to them, We may be ſatisfied when our Reaſonings are true and certain, and when not. (If theſe Rules were ſet into the greateſt Light poſſible by conſidering Men, that could not but be an excellent Means to detect manifeſtly all dangerous Errors. Then it might be ſhewn, that <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> need not be believ'd, tho' the <hi>Trinity</hi> may.) For inſtance.</p>
               <p>We ſee by experience, as was obſerved, that our Eyes deceive us, when, for inſtance, they will judge of the niceſt Circumſtances of Objects at a great diſtance from Us. And therefore We find it rational not to determine our Judgement, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe Particulars, without further Evidence. But if credible Perſons aſſure us, that, to their certain knowledge, that Tower, for inſtance, is Square, which at a diſtance appears Round, We do not at all eſteem it irrational, but moſt agreable to Reaſon, to credit them, before, or rather than, the preſent Judgement of our own Eyes.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, concerning our Spiritual Eye-ſight. There are undoubtedly ſeveral myſterious or ſublime Matters, above the reach of Human Underſtanding. There are ſeveral things, which expreſly appear to be impoſſible, which yet We are ſure are certainly true.</p>
               <p>We have, before, ſuppos'd that there are many ſuch things. To give now ſome Inſtances of them; There are Demonſtrations againſt the Poſſibility of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, holding that there is no <hi>Vacuum;</hi> and, holding a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> there are other
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:37508:35"/>Demonſtrations againſt it: And yet there muſt either be a <hi>Vacuum</hi> or no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and whether there be a <hi>Vacuum</hi> or no, We actually ſee there is Motion.</p>
               <p>In like manner, We are ſure, there muſt be ſuch a thing as Eternity, and it muſt either conſiſt of an eternal Succeſſion of Moments, or elſe it muſt be an eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant without Succeſſion, the whole Eternity always preſent, without any part of it paſt or to come; yet, which of the two ways We hold, We find therein expreſs and moſt manifeſt and unavoidable Contradictions.</p>
               <p>We meet likewiſe with evident Contradictions and Impoſſibilities, whether We aſſert Matter to be diviſible infinitely, or whether We ſuppoſe the contrary; and yet 'tis plain there can be no Medium, but it muſt neceſſarily be either the one or the other.</p>
               <p>There are many ſuch Caſes. Now, what can We ſay to ſuch things, but that they are <hi>myſterious,</hi> and that, ſo far as they are ſo, they are above our Capacity to judge of them, or to determine our ſelves about the <hi>contrary Contradictions</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them?</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe a competent and credible Judge ſhould certify to us which ſide the truth lies; ſo far as that Judge ſhould appear to be a good Judge, it would be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional to aſſent to his Declaration, notwithſtanding the Contradictions which our Reaſon finds in the Subject.</p>
               <p>If ſuch a Judge, for inſtance, ſhould tell us, that Matter is diviſible infinitely, that Eternity is a perpetual Duration without Succeſſion, and that there is no <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum,</hi> it would be irrational not to believe him. Our own Reaſon in ſuch a Caſe ſhews us, that, ſeeing we are credibly aſſured he knows theſe things, not only bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than We, but perfectly well, it is reaſonable to ſubmit all our Difficulties to his Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>It is then moſt evident, that in ſome Caſes the moſt expreſs Contradictions ought not in Reaſon to hinder our belief. For We believe that Matter either is Diviſible infinitely or is not Diviſible infinitely, tho' it is well known there are manifeſt Demonſtrations againſt either of thoſe Syſtems. We firmly believe there is ſuch a thing as Eternity, tho' which way imaginable ſoever We conceive it to be, We find therein unavoidable Contradictions. We believe, that either there is a <hi>Vacuum</hi> or no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> tho' either ſeem abſolutely Impoſſible. And if We knew an infallible Judge in theſe Matters, We would believe him, and ſhould think We ought in Reaſon to believe him, whether he told Us there is a <hi>Vacuum</hi> or told Us there is no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> &amp;c. It appears therefore, that not only We are ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but even that we actually believe, in ſome Caſes, what evidently ſeems to Us to be contradictory and impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Not that what is truely contradictory can be ſuppoſed to be poſſible. But, We muſt own, ſome things may ſeem to Us to be truely contradictory, which really are not ſo: And, therefore, if a Judge, credibly known to be infallible, ſhould tell us that that is not contradictory which ſeems to be ſo to Us, We ought in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe him.</p>
               <p>Now, wherein is it likely We may ſooner be puzled with ſeeming Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than in the moſt ſublime and incomprehenſible Subject, the eternal, the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, the neceſſary, and divine Being? And who in reaſon can be thought a more credible and competent Judge of theſe things, than Almighty God Himſelf?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:37508:35"/>We are ſenſible, that in ſome Caſes We muſt believe ſome things to be true, which yet, after all our beſt reaſonings and inquiries, exprefly ſeem contradictory and impoſſible. And ſhall We not believe the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Syſtem, becauſe of ſome ſeeming Contradictions, tho' God Almighty ſhould aſſure Us it is true? What reaſon can there be for ſuch a Dealing; or how can We reconcile it with our own, avow'd and inconteſtable, Meaſures, in many inſtances?</p>
               <p>The Rule of Reaſon, then, undoubtedly implies; that We are to follow what (after the beſt ſearch We are capable of) appears the moſt evident, notwithſtanding all the Difficulties which otherwiſe the greateſt Credibility may ſeem to be attended with; and that there can be nothing more credible, and no greater or ſurer Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, than the aſſured Teſtimony of the Infallible God.</p>
               <p>Thus We may reconcile together thoſe excellent Directions of Holy Scripture, <hi>in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding to be Men, to prove all things,</hi> and <hi>to judge,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.15. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20.) and yet <hi>not to lean to our own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> (<hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5.) That is, not to ſtick to our own imperfect Imaginations, but to conſider moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly what Right Reaſon after the moſt ſincere and careful atention leads Us to, and inviolably to follow that.</p>
               <p>The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> therefore are unreaſonable, to ſeek any excuſe not to believe the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Syſtem, if it be taught in the Word of God. And thoſe <hi>Trinitarians</hi> take more trouble than needs, or than can be effectual, who content not themſelves to prove the Doctrin of the Trinity out of the Scripture, but attempt to reconcile it to Reaſon. There can be nothing more reaſonable than to believe, when God ſpeaks, whatever Difficulties our own weak and ſhallow Imaginations may find in the Subject-Matter of the (otherwiſe credibly atteſted) Divine Revelation. But ſome <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> as well as the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> ſeem to labour under this Prepoſſeſſion, that Men are to believe nothing of what God tells Us, unleſs it can be ſhewn to be free from all Difficulties, or unleſs all the Objections be anſwered that Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can make againſt it. Let it but be proved that God has ſaid a thing, and then, tho' it be attended with never ſo great, and many, ſeeming Contradictions and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities, it ſuffices Us to hold that it is a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> which We are to believe ſo far as We can find that God has revealed it. Here it is, moſt evidently, our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Service, to ſacrifice our Human Underſtanding to Divine Faith. But this is a Point, which the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> ſeem not to have duely conſidered. Yet they might eaſily obſerve, that God has ſown Difficulties in moſt things in this State of Imperfection and Probation, to make Men both humble and diligent or religiouſly indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, and to try or manifeſt who will be ſincere and careful in the Momentous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry and Search after the Truth, which inconteſtably is of the greateſt Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Us to weigh as it deſerves. The not attending to the right uſe of Reaſon herein, is what makes Men not only <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> but Deiſts, and even Atheiſts. Some will believe no Spirit, becauſe it ſeems a Contradiction that what is not Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſhould act upon Matter. They believe no God, but hold the World to be of itſelf, becauſe they do not conceive that Something can be made out of Nothing, nor are able to imagine how it is poſſible that what is abſolutely Immaterial ſhould produce Matter, and becauſe they do not ſee or underſtand with what Tools as well as with what Materials God made the World. And ſome reject Revelation, on
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37508:36"/>pretence that there are Prophecies in Scripture, and God is in it repreſented as Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with Men; whereas if he did ſo, they think, he would not permit Evil if he could hinder it, and it ſeems to them to be a Contradiction to fore-ſee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Future Contingencies. This ſhews Us, that We ought to be truely humble, and not wiſe in our own conceits, and that if We will not expoſe our ſelves to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, concerning Sublime Matters. We are not raſhly to determine thoſe things to be impoſſible, which to our Reaſon ſeem moſt ſtrange and wonderful. This is the <hi>Firſt</hi> Branch of the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Argument. The <hi>Second</hi> is,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>That the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Interpretations imply ſome most unlikely Aſſertions, and are, beſides that, forced and unnatural, and ſo remote from the obvious Import of the Words that 'tis not to be conceiv'd the generality of Chriſtians can underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in that Senſe.</hi> The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> to avoid the Difficulties of the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem, run to other ſeemingly as great Difficulties. What can, for inſtance, ſeem more impoſſible, than thoſe Aſſertions, that a Creature can perform the Office of a Creator, (which, at leaſt, one would think, is to ſet up two Gods, one Superior and one Inferior, beſides the Holy Ghoſt,) or that the moſt excellent Creature, as like God as poſſible, and in whom the Fulneſs of the God-head dwells, can ever need the Aſſiſtance and Miniſtry of Angels, by the Holy Spirit, or the Spirit of God, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both the Chief and under him the whole Body of Angels; or that, by the Spirit underſtanding the Divine Power and the eſſential Virtue and as it were a Property or a Faculty of God, Chriſt, a Man, and a Creature, ſhould have the Preheminence over it, and be named before it, and be honour'd above it? If theſe things are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable, what do the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> get by their differing from the <hi>Trinitarians?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, the remoteneſs of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Interpretations may in particular be argued by theſe Inſtances. When the generality of Chriſtians read theſe Texts, that the Word is God, and that by him all things, whether in Heaven or Earth, were made and created; is it likely that it will come into their minds, that thereby is meant, that all things were New-modelled by Chriſt, or that ſuppoſing that all things were created by him, yet he is but a Creature that bears the Name of God? If theſe Senſes are ſo far from being obvious, that we may imagine they can ſcarce ſo much as enter into the thoughts of any ordinary Chriſtians; is it credible that they are the true Meaning of thoſe Texts? For can We think the Holy Writers have ſo expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves, as that it ſhould not be poſſible for the greateſt part of Men to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them? We may then be confident,</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>That ſeveral Texts of Scripture, whether put together, or taken aſunder, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to a firm Evidence of the Trinitarian Sentiment.</hi> Beſides <hi>thoſe</hi> aforementioned, <hi>theſe</hi> ſeem expreſs, which call Chriſt by way of eminency the Son of God, and which not only ſhew that Chriſt may and is to be Pray'd to, but declare that God will have Men Honour the Son even as they Honour the Father. Which, it ſeems, after all that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> have ſaid concerning the Worſhip of the Man Jeſus Chriſt, is an invincible Demonſtration that the Son is God, like the Father. In fine, the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> eſteem, all theſe Arguments may alſo be ſtrength'ned, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and laſt, propoſed Conſideration.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) <hi>That, it ſeems, there is no expreſs Text, for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Doctrin, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Trinitarians.</hi> If the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> will confute the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Syſtem, let
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37508:36"/>them produce any deciſive Text for their Sentiment; thereby they will inconteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhew, that all the Texts, which the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> alledge, muſt be underſtood in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Senſe; but this the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> do defy the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> to do. This is ſo weighty a Conſideration, that Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> thinks ſit to inculcate and repeat it a great many times, in his laſt Book, intituled, <hi>The Scripture-Proofs of our Saviour's Divinity explain'd,</hi> &amp;c. To this purpoſe, for inſtance.</p>
               <p>Page, 47. How harſh and unuſual ſoever the Expoſitions of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> might appear, I ſhould allow them to be very Reaſonable, had they firſt well prov'd, that Chriſt is but a Creature, <hi>[that is, in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Senſe,]</hi> and not the eternal and almighty God himſelf; for that alone would be reaſon enough to attribute nothing to him, which cannot belong to a Creature.</p>
               <p>Page, 50. We muſt underſtand Words in a proper and natural Senſe, where there is no apparent reaſon for a Figure; and here is none to take figuratively, as the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> do, theſe words, God, and Son of God, when applied to Chriſt, unleſs they think fit to aſſign his being a mere Creature: Which indeed would be a very good reaſon, could they prove that Chriſt is but a Creature.</p>
               <p>Page, 55. Could any Text be produced, that proves Chriſt to be but a Creature, <hi>[that is, the Dr. muſt mean, as was before remark'd, but ſuch a Creature, as the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians hold, as moſt eminently acts for God, repreſents God, and is aſſiſted of and united to God, according to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Syſtem,]</hi> it would put an end to this Controverſy, and either excuſe or juſtify all their other Interpretations of Scripture, how harſh ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they might otherwiſe appear.</p>
               <p>Page, 58. The whole Controverſy may be put upon this Iſſue, if they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute ours, or eſtabliſh their own Interpretations of Scripture, ſo as to prove ours to be neceſſarily falſe, and theirs conſequently neceſſarily true, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

It is as if a <hi>Papiſt</hi> ſhould make long Harangues to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to prove that Scripture is the Word of God, that God cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd willing to deceive Men, and that therefore we muſt heartily aſſent to and firmly believe whatſoever is contain'd in the Bible. Why, Man! What <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> is there that knows not this, or that denies it? <hi>Proteſtants</hi> profeſs to believe the Holy Scripture, as much, to the full, as any Member of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth. Pretty, then, make no Controverſy about that Matter. But if thou wilt do any thing to the purpoſe, ſhew that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> reject ſome Doctrines certainly taught in God's Word. In like manner, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> maintain that a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> is out of the way who Quarrels with them about <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Reaſon,</hi> and they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge him to ſhew that they make any other Uſe of it than <hi>Protestants</hi> themſelves make in Matters of Religion. So that whenever <hi>Proteſtants</hi> Quarrel with <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian Principles</hi> with relation to this Point, they deviate from their own Rule, and accuſe their own Meaſures, than which nothing can be more unreaſonable and unwarrantable. Either make not Uſe of <hi>the Principle,</hi> or Quarrel not at a like Uſe of it. If, after all, you think, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> make a different Uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, (I ſay, a different Uſe, in Kind, and Extent,) or aſcribe more to Reaſon, than <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do; then, in God's Name, ſhew it, and don't declaim againſt or invalidate your own <hi>Principles;</hi> play not at faſt and looſe, or ſometime hold the ſame <hi>Principles</hi> of Reaſon, and anon reject them and diſpute againſt them. This is what the <hi>

                  <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians do not lay the whole ſtreſs of their Cauſe upon Arguments drawn from Reaſon.</hi> For a Proof of this, the Reader may be referr'd to <hi>Crell</hi>'s Book <hi>Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing One God the Father,</hi> where there are many Arguments from <hi>Scripture</hi> for one taken from the Topick of <hi>Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> did not appeal to Scripture, and offerred not to put the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy upon that Iſſue, and were not willing to be decided chiefly by that, but propoſed wholly to ſet the Divine Revelation aſide, and reſolved only to hearken to what Human Reaſon can inform us of the Matter controverted; the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> would have ſome grounds to blame them, and to aſſert that they gave too much to Reaſon. But the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> expreſly acknowledge, as well as the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians,</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:37508:37"/>both, that Reaſon's Sphere and Reach is not unlimited, that there are many Truths above Reaſon and attended with inextricable Difficulties and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with ſeeming Contradictions, and that therefore what is credibly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated to be is not to be rejected upon the account of ſuch Reaſon-Objections as theſe, where Reaſon is ſhort and doth not ſee clearly and diſtinctly; and, then, expreſly, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> do hold, that in Matters of Revelation the Holy Scripture is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily to be conſulted, and followed, as the Supreme Rule. What will then the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> have, or what can they require more, and what is there here that they can juſtly blame? It is true, indeed, that hereby the Uſe of Reaſon is not wholly diſcarded. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>On the other Hand, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians think, like all Proteſtants, that Reaſon ought not to be wholly Slighted.</hi> For, indeed, what Reaſon ſhews clearly and diſtinctly, no Man in his Senſes, that duely conſiders, will contemn it or reject it. And, in reaſon, We ought not, lightly, to take any Thing in a Senſe, that ſeems contrary to Reaſon, when there is no abſolute Neceſſity for it, or when that Thing may be taken in another Senſe. It is certain, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> allow as much to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and hold that <hi>Scripture</hi> is to be underſtood conſiſtently and agreably to theſe <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Principles,</hi> ſo that when the Words of Scripture in their literal Signification imply ſomething <hi>manifeſtly contrary to Reaſon,</hi> they muſt be taken in any other Senſe that they may be ſuſceptible of. In ſhort, Proteſtants doubt not but that the whole Scripture perfectly agrees with Right Reaſon, and therefore they take it <hi>as much as poſſible</hi> in Senſes <hi>evidently agreable to Reaſon,</hi> and they expreſly reject thoſe Senſes which are <hi>plainly inconſiſtent with it.</hi> Upon that account, all Proteſtants hold, that We muſt neceſſarily <hi>make <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Reaſon in interpreting of Scripture,</hi> if We will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it right. Accordingly, they conſult and uſe Reaſon, both, in <hi>expounding the Text</hi> of Scripture, and in <hi>drawing the natural and neceſſary Conſequences</hi> from it. And agreably to theſe juſt Meaſures, they take in a <hi>Figurative</hi> Senſe thoſe <hi>Texts,</hi> which according to the <hi>Literal</hi> Sound of the Words manifeſtly appear to our Reaſon to be unworthy of God and to be expreſly contrary to Reaſon. Upon that account, they underſtand <hi>figuratively,</hi> for inſtance, that Saying of our Saviour's, that the Bread of the Euchariſt is his Body, and that except We Eat his Fleſh and Drink his Blood we cannot have Eternal Life, as alſo thoſe Expreſſions which aſcribe to God a Body or bodily Parts, the Saying of <hi>Moſes</hi> that God laboured and reſted, the Term which imports that <hi>Jeptha</hi> Sacrificed his Daughter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians deſire not to make any other <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Reaſon.</hi> But then they maintain, that by no means they ought to be hindered to make <hi>the like</hi> Uſe of it, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſo juſtly do, or ſo juſtly plead for, for inſtance, in the Controverſies with the Church of <hi>Rome. What Reaſon ſhews clearly and diſtinctly,</hi> they eſteem, <hi>ought not to be unregarded.</hi> They hold, therefore, that We are not raſhly to underſtand or interpret Scripture in <hi>Senſes manifeſtly contrary to Reaſon,</hi> when (eſpecially) that Scripture appears <hi>ſuſceptible of ſome other Senſe.</hi> And they affirm, that this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is not only moſt evidently <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>rational,</hi> but alſo <hi>expreſly agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Proteſtant Principles and Practice,</hi> as has been ſhewn, So that, We muſt needs conclude, God ſurely will not take it ill, but on the contrary He cannot but require, that We ſhould thus <hi>reaſon,</hi> or make uſe of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Conſideration,</hi> as the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37508:38"/>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> here would do, ſo as to have ſome regard, and make ſome inquiry, Whether things agree or diſagree with the Common Notions of <hi>Human <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, where <hi>Reaſon</hi> doth <hi>not</hi> ſee <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>diſtinctly,</hi> ſeeming Difficulties ought not to be looked upon as wholly concluſive; and, moſt particularly, Difficulties then ought, in reaſon, to be reck'ned of no weight, againſt a thing which <hi>manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or moſt credibly appears to be.</hi> But the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> aſſert, (as has been ſhewn in the <hi>Apologia pro Irenico Magno,</hi>) that this is not the Caſe with the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Doctrin. They humbly repreſent, that the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> cannot ſay, that the Doctrin of <hi>three Perſons in one God</hi> is <hi>moſt credible and manifeſt in it ſelf,</hi> nor <hi>inconteſtably expreſs in Scripture.</hi> But, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> aſſert, on the contrary, it is moſt clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly evident, that that Doctrin is <hi>inconſiſtent with ſeveral Texts,</hi> as well as <hi>implies many moſt expreſs Contradictions and manifeſt Impoſſibilities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Trinitarians</hi> then have no juſt grounds, to compare <hi>this</hi> Point, with ſome Things that are <hi>Inconteſtable,</hi> or <hi>abſolutely out of our Sight.</hi> For tho' <hi>the Whole of God</hi> cannot be <hi>perfectly comprehenſible,</hi> yet <hi>in general ſome things of God</hi> may be <hi>clearly diſcerned,</hi> and therefore <hi>God</hi> is unanimouſly acknowledg'd in that ſenſe to be <hi>an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Reaſon,</hi> and all Parties affirm or deny ſome things of <hi>God</hi> upon the account of their being evidently agreable or diſagreable to <hi>Reaſon:</hi> There is no reaſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, why the ſame Meaſures ſhould not be followed, with reſpect to the <hi>Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> Controverſy; And plainly then that is very unreaſonable which the <hi>Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> ſo earneſtly deſire, that <hi>no account at all</hi> ſhould be made of the <hi>ſo many, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and ſo obvious Contradictions and Impoſſibilities</hi> which appear to be implied in the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Doctrin. If <hi>they</hi> were <hi>only obſcure and uncertain Difficulties,</hi> and if the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Doctrin were <hi>moſt manifeſt and certain</hi> or unavoidable, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted by any Scripture-Evidence, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> would be to blame to inſiſt on this Plea of <hi>Reaſon:</hi> But, as was ſaid, the Caſe will be found to be <hi>quite otherwiſe,</hi> if it be duly conſidered; And if ſo, <hi>the unjuſt and unreaſonable Meaſures that are taken, will be a Shame to the preſent, and a Wondering to future Times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Arguments of the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> in fine, are not infallible, which import, that ſome <hi>certain and inconteſtable Truths</hi> are incumbred with any <hi>most expreſs and unavoidable Contradictions.</hi> It is certain that ſome Truths are <hi>above Reaſon</hi> to give an account How they are, (and thoſe are true <hi>Myſteries,</hi>) but it doth not follow that they are <hi>contrary to Reaſon.</hi> It were indeed the greateſt Folly, upon any Difficulties, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any Thing which manifeſtly appears to be. But if the Manner or the Things concerning thoſe Difficulties were rightly ſtated &amp; underſtood, they might appear to be free from Contradictions; for real <hi>Contradictions</hi> cannot be <hi>true.</hi> It is Men's raſh Judgment, then, that concludes a Truth to be attended with Contradictions, when really it is not ſo. I doubt not but that thoſe Syſtems, if duly conſidered, may be vindicated from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, which aſſert, that there is no <hi>Vacuum,</hi> that Matter is diviſible infinitely, that Eternity conſiſts in a perpetual Succeſſion of Moments. It is true We are not to lean too much to our own Underſtandings, or to be ſtiff to our Prepoſſeſſions &amp; Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without ſufficient knowledge of the Cauſe and without due examination. But then, on the other hand, it is known, We are bid in Underſtanding to be Men, &amp; to prove all things to the beſt of our power, that is, thoſe things eſpecially that concern our
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37508:38"/>eternal Welfare. And by that means God tries our Sincerity and our real Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the moſt momentous Matters. We muſt not then reject the Uſe of our Reaſon.</p>
               <p>It is indeed certain, and evident, thoſe are faulty and criminal, who, when Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Revelation are ſo well prov'd and credibly atteſted and confirmed, diſpute either of them, becauſe they do not know how things were created, and with what Inſtruments God made the World, (as if He needed any,) or becauſe they do not underſtand how God can forſee Events, and why He permits Evil. No wiſe Man will agree, that <hi>theſe Difficulties</hi> expreſly imply <hi>unavoidable Contradictions.</hi> And all good Men will grant, that the groſſeſt Solution of theſe Objections renders the Infidels utterly inexcuſable. Now what conſidering Chriſtian will ſay, that the ſaid, or any the like, Objections are abſolutely unanſwerable? The moſt difficult Objections inconteſtably are thoſe of <hi>Spinoza</hi> and <hi>Bayle.</hi> Yet we ſee them anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the one by the moſt Reverend Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> in his Book <hi>De Origine Mali,</hi> and the other by the Famous Dr. <hi>Henry More</hi> in the Second Part of his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſicks.</hi> There are ſome Anſwers to thoſe Objections, which need not take up above two Sheets, and to which the Infidels can not reply with the leaſt colour of Reaſon. As to the reſt, the Reader may be referred to the 12th. Chapter of the <hi>Apologia pro Irenico Magno,</hi> which compriſes <hi>a general Anſwer</hi> to the <hi>Objections</hi> againſt <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Reaſon.</hi> Yet certainly it is not neceſſary, that all Difficulties againſt Religion ſhould expreſly be anſwered. It is undoubtedly ſufficient, that it be ſolidly prov'd, and that it appear moſt rational and credible. And when we are aſſured that God ſays any thing, we may rationally believe it, and ought in reaſon to do ſo, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding any ſeeming Difficulties, inferior to a ſtronger and clearer Evidence. Howbeit, on the other hand, that the Inferiority of ſuch Difficulties be moſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evinced, the eſſaying to reſolve Difficulties, as much as poſſible, ought by no means to be diſcouraged. For, if things be duly conſidered, Religion will then be ſufficiently vindicated and illuſtrated; and otherwiſe it may often be ſadly miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented and corrupted, as well as wretchedly expoſed to the Calumnies of the Infidels.</p>

The <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarian</hi> Objection it ſelf, (implying that what is incredible is to be rejected,) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides the Matter. The chief Inſtances, of the pretended Remoteneſs of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Interpretations, are particularly concerning the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Expoſitions of <hi>Chriſts Creating all things,</hi> and in what Senſe <hi>the Word is</hi> ſaid to be <hi>God,</hi> &amp;c. Now to the latter the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> obſerve, that, if we will underſtand that Text aright, we muſt not determine our ſelves about the Senſe of it before we have conſidered what <hi>the Scripture</hi> elſewhere teaches, as well as <hi>Reaſon,</hi> concerning <hi>this Perſon</hi> that is here called <hi>the Word,</hi> and that if it appear that thereby <hi>a Creature</hi> is meant, as even according to them it evidently doth, then there can be no difficulty in explaining the Title of <hi>God</hi> which is attributed to <hi>the Word,</hi> but we muſt neceſſarily take it in an <hi>Inferior</hi> Signification, in which it may be applied, and we find it is ſometimes <hi>in Scripture</hi> communicated, to a <hi>Creature,</hi> eſpecially <hi>our Saviour</hi> himſelf (accordingly) warning us that ſome <hi>Creatures</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> are called <hi>Gods, John,</hi> 10.34, 35. <hi>Angels</hi> in <hi>the Original</hi> are termed <hi>Gods, Pſ.</hi> 8.5. &amp;c. And it was common among <hi>the Heathens</hi> to give <hi>that Title</hi> to others beſide thoſe whom they accounted <hi>the Supreme Gods.</hi> The giving then of <hi>that Title</hi> to ſome <hi>Creature,</hi> in <hi>an Inferiour Senſe,</hi> was not at all <hi>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,</hi> either to <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Indeed, one of the Deſigns of Chriſtianity was to inform the <hi>Pagans,</hi> that there are not many <hi>Gods, in the ſupreme or proper Senſe of that word,</hi> but <hi>only One ſuch God,</hi> to whom alone Divine Worſhip is due. But the Goſpel never intended to ſignify, that there are not many, in Heaven and Earth, that may be termed <hi>Gods</hi> in <hi>an inferior Senſe,</hi> according to <hi>the Scripture</hi> as well as <hi>the Gentile-Stile.</hi> If St. <hi>Thomas</hi> directed his Speech to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in that exclamation, <hi>My Lord, and My God;</hi> he might mean no more than if he had ſaid, <hi>My Prince, and My Soveraign!</hi> The <hi>Trinitarians</hi> own, that, by <hi>the Word,</hi> in the beginning of St. <hi>John's</hi> Goſpel, is meant <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Now <hi>Reaſon</hi> it ſelf ſhews us manifeſtly, that we muſt not take Chriſt to be the Supreme God. For Chriſt is a <hi>Man,</hi> and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways own'd to be but <hi>one Perſon;</hi> but God is a diſtinct Spirit, and conſequenly a diſtinct Perſon, for an intelligent Being, whether Divine or Human, has all that is requiſite to the conſtituting of a Perſon, and ſo cannot always but be a diſtinct Perſon; two Spirits then muſt needs be two Perſons: And therefore Chriſt, being but one Perſon, and being known to be a Human Perſon or a Man, cannot in reaſon be imagined to be the Moſt High God. And there cannot be more than one Perſon in God, for God is always ſpoken of and to in the Singular Number by Pronouns that imply a Perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the Scripture ſpeaks to us as to <hi>Men,</hi> who are bound to make uſe of their <hi>Senſe and Reaſon,</hi> and for a trial thereof Figurative Expreſſions are ſometimes employed.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> as is to be obſerved in the Fourth Particular, ſhew by divers unanſwerable and expreſs Arguments taken out of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>a Creature,</hi> and is not literally the God Almighty himſelf, but only his Chief Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and Repreſentative, and the moſt excellent and moſt dignified Creature, in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37508:39"/>whom God moſt extraordinarily and moſt intimately dwells, and in and by whom God moſt wonderfully works. And therefore if by <hi>the Word,</hi> in the beginning of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, ſhould literally be underſtood God himſelf, or ſome Influence of the Divine Nature as it were incarnated with or conſtantly dwelling in and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Man Chriſt Jeſus, it would not follow, that Chriſt is literally the Supreme God himſelf, or that there are more Perſons than one in the God head.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>the Creation attributed to Chriſt,</hi> it is ſufficiently evident it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of <hi>ſuch a Creation as a Creature is capable of,</hi> if Chriſt appear to be a Creature. Prophets, God's Creatures and Miniſters, are ſaid to do Super-natural Works and raiſe the Dead, tho' it be not they properly that do ſuch things, but God, by them, at their preſence, at their ſtreching out of their hand, at their word or requeſt, and the like. They do not the Miraculous Work by their mere Strength, or by their own Power, but by a Divine Power thus inherent in them, or annexed to them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying and aſſiſting them, and working at their deſire; and yet they, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are ſaid to do the Work. For inſtance, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.8. Our Saviour bids his Diſciples <hi>Heal the Sick, Cleanſe the Lepers, Raiſe the Dead;</hi> and in <hi>John,</hi> 14.12. he tells them, that they ſhould do moſt wonderful Works: now, inconteſtably, that ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, that God would do thoſe Works by them, or that they ſhould do 'em by God's Aſſiſtance, or with the concurrence of the Divine Power working at their deſire. In like manner, the Firſt-born might Create the World, or might be ſaid to Create the World; and God might be ſaid to Create the World by him, as it is ſaid that <hi>by the Hands of the Apoſtles were many Signs and Wonders wrought, Acts</hi> 5.12. God was pleas'd to work <hi>by thoſe Hands,</hi> which of themſelves were not able to do theſe Miracles, but were enabled to do them by the concurring Aſſiſtance of the Power of God annexed to them or accompanying them. <hi>To Raiſe the Dead, or Cure the Blind,</hi> is as well above Natural Power, as <hi>to Create the World;</hi> tho' to Create the World be more than to Cure the Blind, and tho' a Creature which Creates the World, or which may be ſaid to Create the World, has a greater Concurrence of the Divine Power annexed or united to him, than one that only Cures the Blind. (Howbeit, certainly, a Creature which ſo repreſents God, as to be Worſhipped with God, tho' but as the moſt highly dignified Creature poſſible, muſt undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be infinitely more united to the God-head, than one which only doth ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, or than any Prophet or Apoſtle, before whom 'tis not lawful to bow the Knee, or on whoſe Name 'tis not lawful to call.) Moreover, we muſt conſider, it is undoubted and moſt obvious, that often in Scripture by <hi>Creating</hi> is only meant <hi>diſpoſing,</hi> or <hi>modelling, faſhioning,</hi> and <hi>ſetting in order.</hi> (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.10. and 4.24. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) There is then not only no reaſon, why <hi>the Creation</hi> attributed to <hi>Chriſt</hi> (even if it were <hi>the Firſt Creation</hi>) ſhould not be taken <hi>in that Senſe;</hi> but there may be an abſolute neceſſity it ſhould be <hi>ſo underſtood,</hi> if <hi>Christ</hi> appear to be a Creature, tho' never ſo intimately united to the God head: And, ſo, <hi>that</hi> is then obvious enough to thoſe who will diligently attend to the Stile of the Scripture; and it is not God's intendment, that any others ſhould come to the true knowledge of it.

                  </q>) The Secret of the Lord is with them, who fear him, and who conſequently do what they can to know exactly his
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:37508:40"/>Law and reveal'd Will. (Will any ſay, that there are not ſome Expreſſions in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be underſtood in as ſeemingly a far-fetch'd Senſe, as any given by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians?</hi>) If Men miſtake when they have done what they well can in their circumſtances to be informed aright, it is credible that God will judge that a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable Caſe, ſo they be humble and moderate, and be not violent, magiſterial, and imperious, and do not pretend to impoſe their Sentiment on others, but be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in abſtruſe Matters to unite in the Generality of the Terms of Scripture. In that manner, the moſt ignorant, not being ſo thro' their fault, may be ſafe. But God has not left the Scripture into tho hands only of unlearned and unthinking Men, immerſed in and moſtly taken up with the concerns and buſineſſes of this Life. Tho' all Chriſtians are bound in ſome meaſure to ſearch and meditate upon the Scriptures, God has ſet up an Order of Men, whoſe particular Vocation is to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt other Men as much as poſſible in the right underſtanding of the Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And ſurely no poſſible Means ought to be neglected, which are Subſervient to that great end. And if theſe Means were freely, calmly and impartially us'd, (which would be if Miniſters were fairly to repreſent the Reaſons <hi>Pro</hi> and <hi>Con</hi> in Difficult Matters, without deciding, condemning, and impoſing,) then all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Truths would ſoon be diſcern'd, and it would therefore eaſily be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all Chriſtians what may be meant by the <hi>Creation attributed to Chriſt</hi> in Scripture, or how far the underſtanding of that Point is neceſſary, and in what Generality this and the like ought to be leſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Chief Inſtances,</hi> then, which the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> give, of <hi>the pretended incredible Aſſertions, implied in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Expoſitions,</hi> are theſe: <hi>That a Creature could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Office of a Creator:</hi> And then, <hi>That one in whom the Fulneſs of the God-head dwells, ſhould need the Aſſiſtance of Angels;</hi> and, <hi>on the other hand, That a Creature ſhould be more honourable than, and ſhould have the preheminence over, and be named before, the Power of God, by the Holy Ghoſt underſtanding an Influence of the Divine Power or the Divine Inſpiration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a Creature could perform the Office of a Creatour.</hi> Even at moſt, upon as good grounds, the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> might make the ſame Difficulty, againſt Men <hi>producing other Men,</hi> or the Sun <hi>cauſing the Seeds of things to grow unto Perfection and into a beautiful Order.</hi> Indeed, the Sun is not properly a Creatour, nor are Men properly Creatours, but they are <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in the Hands of the Creatour. God is pleas'd to make uſe of them, in the effecting of thoſe Works; but, all the while, He concurrs with them, as well as prepares the Subject for them: He not only provides the Matter and Means, and endues the Inſtruments with a fit Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, but He alſo upholds and aſſiſts them, and works <hi>with</hi> as well as <hi>by</hi> them. In like manner, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> obſerve it is not ſaid that <hi>the Word is the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour</hi> or <hi>Maker,</hi> but that <hi>by him God made</hi> the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>When <hi>the Word</hi> was created, (or that moſt excellent Perſon which is the moſt expreſs Image of the Divine Wiſdom, and is therefore in that ſenſe call'd the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God,) the firſt Being which God then produced, and which, with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Concurrence of <hi>the Word,</hi> He faſhioned and perfected, was (according to the moſt illuſtrious <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi>) another very eminent Creature, which not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for diſtinction-ſake, but alſo for his excellent Perfection and the deſignation of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37508:40"/>his Office, was called <hi>the Holy Spirit</hi> and <hi>the Power of God.</hi> But tho' <hi>the Word</hi> had a part in the faſhioning or modelling of him, or in the medial and inſtrumental pouring vital or ſpiritual influences upon him, yet he had ſo little ſhare in the Work, in compariſon of that which God had in it, that not <hi>the Word</hi> himſelf, but <hi>God</hi> only, is to be reckoned as the <hi>Producer</hi> or <hi>Maker</hi> of that <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> And for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, God only is called the Author of all the other Creatures, tho' both <hi>the Word</hi> and the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> had a hand, together with God, in the drawing of them out of the Chaos. God prepared the Chaos, and, having created <hi>the Word,</hi> and by the Word <hi>the Spirit,</hi> by the breathing and moving of the Spirit he gave <hi>Motion</hi> to other Creatures that were ſet into a ſit Order to that end. Yet all Creatures and even the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> are ſaid to belong to <hi>the Word,</hi> becauſe in the creating of them God deſigned to Subject them all to <hi>the Word;</hi> and, accordingly, they were all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to him, from the beginning, tho' then ſo only as Servants are Subject to a Son in his Minority in his Father's Houſe, whereas after Chriſt's Paſſion, and Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were Subjected to him as to the Maſter of the Houſe himſelf, or as to a Son com to Age to whom the Father commits the Government of the Houſe. If by <hi>the Word,</hi> in the beginning of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, be to be underſtood not only the Firſt created Spirit, but alſo a Divine Virtue and Influence united to and aſſiſting that moſt excellent Creature, it is eaſy to conceive that <hi>the Word</hi> might be <hi>Inſtrumental</hi> in Creating the Chaos, or the World out of the Chaos. Howbeit, nothing in Scripture or Reaſon contradicts the Syſtem, implying, that the Chaos is an eternal Emanation of God; that it is a confus'd Mixture of (unactive) Material and Spiritual Natures; that <hi>Creating</hi> is the putting ſome of them in a certain <hi>Motion</hi> and <hi>Order;</hi> that all Spiritual Creatures have a Material Vehicle; that, the Material Vehicle being prepared, God, with what ſomtimes is called <hi>his Word</hi> &amp; what is called <hi>his Breath,</hi> forces into it ſome Portion of the Spiritual Nature ſcattered in the Chaos; that what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſomtimes alſo calls <hi>the Word,</hi> (that is the Soul of the Meſſiah,) and the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> (thereby then meaning a Creature,) are the largeſt Portions of the Spiritual Part of the Chaos that God ever put together; and that <hi>the Word</hi> and <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> being created, God made uſe of them to <hi>Create,</hi> or Breath upon, and <hi>Put into a fit Motion and Order,</hi> the reſt of the Creatures.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>H. Spirit</hi> then (ſo far as that title may be applied to other beſide God) may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>the</hi> Chief of the Elect Angels, or of the Seven Archangels, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.21.) which are repreſented immediately ſurrounding, &amp; ſtanding before, the Throne of Glory, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4. Moſt probably, ſuch a glorious Creature, as incomparably ſurpaſſes all the other Archan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Excellency of Nature, is then primarily to be underſtood by the <hi>H. Spirit:</hi> Yet it may be alſo, that the whole Body of Angels <hi>under him,</hi> &amp; conſequently every Angel, may ſometime be <hi>thereby</hi> meant. For the term, <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> may be a Collective Word, implying then ſeveral Holy Spirits, or all the Holy Angels; every Holy Angel being a Holy and Pure Spirit: And what all the Subordinate Angels do, at the Command of their Cheif, is reck'ned as done by him, who (when he has receiv'd the Orders of <hi>the Word</hi>) divides to them their Tasks, and originally is the Holy Spirit, or Holy Angel, by excellency; and, ſo, in that reſpect, theſe Works are repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as performed by One Holy Spirit, and the whole Body of Holy Angels is then reputed as if it were but One Holy Angel; as, in ſpeaking of what is done by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, the Scripture mentions but One of thoſe Impure Beings, as if there were but
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37508:41"/>one ſuch, (<hi>the Evil One,</hi> or <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholy Spirit,)</hi> what all the Devils do being aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Chief, who Commands and Directs them in all things.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, there is no reaſon why we may not think, that <hi>One Immenſe Spirit,</hi> next to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>the Word,</hi> may not be ſuppos'd to do all that is attributed to the Holy Spirit. For the Excellency of the Holy Spirit may be ſo great, as to have incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably greater Powers and Perfections than all the Angels and all other Inferior Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures put together, and even almoſt to equal <hi>the Word</hi> except in Dignity. <hi>One Sun</hi> and <hi>One Moon</hi> pour their Influences effectually upon all the Seeds and Creatures in the World. And do we think that God could not frame an excellent Spirit, or two excellent Spirits, ſo powerful, as to be able to do the like to all Human Spirits on Earth, and to ſhine upon them all, and enlighten and guide them, and ſuggeſt good Motions to them, and watch alone over them, if not with the Concurrence alſo of other Angels, (which yet cannot be doubted of,) as Spiritual Stars in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of thoſe other moſt excellent Spirits?</p>
               <p>Yet all theſe Holy Spirits are but the diſpoſing <hi>Inſtruments</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Divine Power,</hi> which, at their working, together works <hi>by</hi> and <hi>with</hi> them. <hi>The Word</hi> has the diſpoſition of the Divine Power, of that which is his particular and ordinary Attendant, and even of that which God himſelf immediately exerciſes, and of that alſo the diſpoſition of which is given to the Holy Spirit and to the Angels. For <hi>the Word,</hi> having receiv'd that Priviledge, has made the Holy Spirit partaker of a vaſt Share of the Divine Power above all Angels, according to this Syſtem. And to every Angel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Station, is alloted likewiſe by <hi>the Word's</hi> Appointment, Authorized there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by God, a certain Portion of the Adminiſtration of the Divine Power, which always accompanies them, and concurrs with them at their Working, and which properly doth the Wonders, or the Chiefeſt Part of them, in the effecting of Super-natural Works. They are as it were but <hi>the Bearers</hi> of the Divine Virtue, or the <hi>Diſpoſers</hi> of it, which God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſts to them, becauſe in that Employment they reap the glory &amp; delight of Serving God and of being Inſtrumental in the good of Others. They diſpoſe therefore of that Portion of Divine Power, as they diſpoſe of their own Faculties. (That which was alloted to a Prophet, was called <hi>his</hi> Spirit. 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 2 15. and 5.26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3, 4.) But <hi>the Word,</hi> eſpecially ſince his Exaltation, has the Diſpoſition of the Divine Power (as was ſaid) of all the Holy Angels, whom he ſends whenſoever he will on Errands to do what He pleaſes; and ſo he is ſaid to have received <hi>the Spirit without Meaſure,</hi> whereas no Prophet before him had (and that but at ſometimes) the Share but of an Angel, or at moſt the Aſſiſtance it may be of two or three Angels and the Power accompanying them or annexed to them. That by the Holy Spirit ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like this (<hi>Viz:</hi> ſome Angel or Angels, together with a certain Concurrence of God's Acting or a certain Influence of the Divine Power) is to be underſtood, and not altogether and expreſly God himſelf or a literally and properly Divine Perſon; is evinced by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Arguments in <hi>the Brief Hiſtory,</hi> in <hi>the Apology for the Irenicum Magnum,</hi> and in <hi>Crell</hi>'s <hi>Book Of one God the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is certain, that, in <hi>Job,</hi> 32.8. <hi>the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>the Divine Inſpiration,</hi> are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly put as <hi>Synonyma,</hi> or as Terms that imply and explain one the other; (the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Words, <hi>Rouak</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Pneuma</hi> in the <hi>Greek,</hi> being undoubtedly ſuſceptible of that Senſe, not only ſignifying <hi>Spirit,</hi> but properly ſignifying <hi>Breath,</hi> or <hi>Breathing,</hi> which is likewiſe the import of <hi>Afflatus,</hi> the Expreſſion, Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37508:41"/>alſo, us'd, in <hi>Latin,</hi> to imply <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> which is repreſented as a Spiritual Breathing, or a certain Acting of the Divine Power figured by Breathing.) And, on the other hand, in <hi>John,</hi> 1.32. compared with <hi>John,</hi> 1.51. <hi>Acts.</hi> 8.26.29.39. <hi>Revel.</hi> 8.3. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26. and ſeveral other Places, the Spirit, and an Angel, or the Angels, (<hi>John,</hi> 1.51. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.7. compared with <hi>Acts,</hi> 2.3, 4.) are alſo put as the ſame or <hi>ſynonymous</hi> terms. From whence it ſeems it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that by the Spirit we muſt underſtand; <hi>the Divine Inſpiration carried and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Means of a Holy Spirit, or Holy Angel;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>an Acting and Influence of the Divine Power communicated to or performed on ſome Men at the Preſence and Acting of an Angel;</hi> or which is the ſame, <hi>a Holy Angel, acting, according to the Direction of the Divine Inſpiration, and together with the Aſſiſtance (and a certain Inſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) of the Divine Power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus <hi>the Spirit</hi> is, both, a Creature, and not a Creature; an Angel, and alſo the Spiritual Breath of God, or a certain Virtue of God, or an Influence of the Power of God, which is Something belonging to the Father, or a certain Acting of the Father, but appears not, and need not be concluded, and in reaſon cannot be thought, to be a particular &amp; real Divine Perſon diſtinct from the Father: As by <hi>the Word</hi> is underſtood, both, the Firſt-Born, (the Word-Bearer, and the Chief of all Creatures,) and a Divine Word, or an Influence of the Father's Wiſdom and Divine Nature, dwelling in and as intimately as poſſible united with the Firſt-Born.</p>
               <p>(The Father, according to theſe Notions, may then truly be ſaid, to be the whole God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head or the only true God, and to know alone all things; but then, by the Influences of his Divine <hi>Word</hi> &amp; <hi>Spirit,</hi> he may manifeſt to others what He pleaſes, &amp; that when he thinks fit, &amp; properly 'tis not <hi>the Father</hi> that is Incarnate but his <hi>Word;</hi> which is agreable to Scripture as well as Reaſon. And the Spirit may be ſaid by a Figure, to ſearch the things of God. See <hi>Crell</hi>'s, <hi>Touching One God,</hi> &amp;c. Book, 1. Sect. 3. Chap. 14. And indeed who beſides God ſhould know or ſearch the things of God but the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, or they to whom it is reveal'd by the Divine Inſpiration? In the Form of Baptiſm, and in the Creed, the Word and the Spirit may well be mentioned, after mention made in general of the Father, tho' they be not Divine Perſons di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Father, but be certain Influences of the Divine Perfections, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Actings of the Father by ſome Powers or Virtues belonging to his Nature. The Form of Baptiſm thus implies, that thereby we are Conſecrated the Diſciples of God, our Father and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Diſciples of the Word communicated to Chriſt who has Redeemed us by his Doctrine and by his Blood, and in fine of the Holy Inſpiration alſo which Confirms the Goſpel and Sanctifies the Soul of true Believers. And, in the Creed, we profeſs this Belief. Evidently, herein is no <hi>Tautology,</hi> nor any thing Superfluous. For <hi>the Father</hi> and <hi>his Influences,</hi> or <hi>God</hi> and the moſt eminent <hi>Actings of his Powers,</hi> are things diſtinct. And thoſe Actings and Influences are not therefore known, tho' the Father be, and tho' they belong to the Father. And tho' they were Neceſſarily in the Father, it would not be Impertinent to particularize them, after having made mention of the Father. As after having ſaid that there is <hi>a Sun,</hi> it would not be irrational to add that we believe and know the <hi>Sun</hi> produceth <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Heat.</hi> Otherwiſe indeed what could the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> themſelves plead, for mentioning the Son and Spirit after the Father, when they hold that the whole Son and Spirit are wholly in the Father, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:37508:42"/>that the Father cannot be without them? Now according to our Syſtem, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit implying an Influence and an Acting of the Divine Nature, thoſe may well be ſaid to be the Temple of God in whom the Divine Inſpiration reſides, tho' the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſpiration be not a Perſon, or not a Perſon diſtinct from the Father. Indeed tho' the Divine Inſpiration were only the Acting of an Angel commiſſionated and directed by God, Chriſtians in whom the Impiration works might then alſo be truly ſaid to be the Temple of God, and not of the Angel, becauſe the Angel works not for himſelf or on his own account, but as ſent and ordered by God and Chriſt, and then, according to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Phraſe, <hi>Apoſtolus cujuſque est quiſque;</hi> as when an Embaſſador Wedds a Princeſs in his Maſter's Name, She is not thereby Married to the Subject, but to the Prince that ſent him. And the Angels may be called by way of eminence the Breath of God, inaſmuch as they proceed from him, as our Breath doth from us; or moſt probably inaſmuch as they carry the Influence of the Divine Spirit or Power, as <hi>God's-Word Bearer</hi> is called <hi>God's Word</hi> inaſmuch as he carries the Commands of God, and both acts by Gods' Power and Wiſdom, and repreſents and exhibits God's Majeſty and Authority dwelling in him.)</p>
               <p>It has been neceſſary to make all theſe Digreſſions, particularly concerning the Holy Spirit, further to illuſtrate the <hi>Arian Syſtem,</hi> concerning the Holy Spirit's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Perſon, as well as that of <hi>the Word,</hi> in order to ſhew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>Not but that <hi>the Word</hi> might and did from the beginning bear the Title of <hi>God,</hi> in an Inſerior Signification, even if it were but inaſmuch as he repreſented God, and commanded in God's ſtead or in God's Moſt Supreme Authority to the Higheſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures next to Him; (to ſettle which Honour upon him, &amp; extend it in the Higheſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and ſo to continue it to him, in the Oeconomy of the Goſpel, God required this Condition of him, that he ſhould freely undertake the Redemption of Mankind; for otherwiſe Mankind had periſhed, and conſequently the Firſt-Born, tho' he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued as he was, remaining Innocent, ſhould not have had Men for his Subjects:) Howbeit, the <hi>Arians</hi> do not ſay that <hi>the</hi> (created) <hi>Word</hi> is eternal, and infinite, and ſelf-exiſtent, or ſelf-moving, nor conſequently that he has all Perfection, or any Perfection and Power, <hi>of himſelf;</hi> now, every one knows, this is the Deſcription of him who is <hi>literally and properly God,</hi> and this belongs only to <hi>the Father,</hi> and therefore with the Apoſtle it may well be ſaid, that tho' there be <hi>many</hi> who are called <hi>Gods</hi> in Heaven and Earth, yet the <hi>

So God ſays by him, <hi>Let this be don,</hi> and it is don, himſelf ſhewing the Example of Obedience, and doing what is incumbent upon him, God having ſhewn him what is to be don; for, the Matter, for inſtance, being prepared, and God working firſt thereupon, <hi>the Word, then, with the Divine Aſſiſtance,</hi> doth all that he ſees the Father do, and he ſets the Angels a doing all that they are enabled to perform. And ſo, in the beginning, the Work was effected, in diſpoſing the Chaos into the Beauty and Order and Regularity of a World, <hi>the Word</hi> being the General under God. And what could be Impoſſible <hi>to ſuch a Creature, aſſiſted of God,</hi> as has been ſaid?</p>
               <p>It is to be noted, that, not <hi>the Word,</hi> but <hi>the Holy Spirit,</hi> is call'd <hi>the Power of God;</hi> becauſe, ſince the Creation, it is by <hi>the Holy Spirit</hi> that ordinary Miracles are commonly wrought: So that properly or chiefly the Office of <hi>the Word</hi> now eſpecially is to <hi>command,</hi> and that of <hi>the Holy Spirit</hi> or of the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels is to <hi>execute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all, there is nothing <hi>ſo expreſs</hi> in Scripture, concerning this <hi>intricate</hi> Subject, but that many may opine that the <hi>Socinian Syſtem,</hi> concerning <hi>the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit,</hi> or the Manner of <hi>the Creation attributed to Chriſt,</hi> may be the trueſt. Nevertheleſs, it is certain, ſeveral Paſſages ſeem very much to favour the <hi>Arian Hypotheſis,</hi> and there is nothing in it that is abſurd, or in it ſelf incredible and apparently impoſſible. As to the other <hi>Inſtances,</hi> which the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> give, of the pretended <hi>unaccountable Aſſertions</hi> held by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> they are much eaſier than the former to be accounted for, and have indeed but little difficulty in them.</p>
               <p>The next <hi>Inſtance</hi> is, <hi>That one in whom the Fulneſs of the Godhead dwells, ſhould need the Aſſiſtance of Angels.</hi> The Anſwer to this is, that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> do not ſay <hi>the Godhead needs</hi> the Aſſiſtance of Angels, but only (for divers reaſons, ſome of which have before been intimated) <hi>is pleas'd to make uſe</hi> of their Service. And it cannot becom the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> to find this ſtrange, ſeeing they hold <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be <hi>perſonally-united with the Deity,</hi> and yet they know the Scripture in many Places teaches that the Angels miniſter to him and are employed by him, an Angel aſſiſted and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and comforted him in his Agony, and when he was apprehended he ſaid that if he would have reſiſted he would have made uſe of the Protection of Angels, of whom he might preſently have had more than twelve Legions for the asking. It ſeems indeed unaccountable, that a God Almighty (or a Perſon that were God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty) ſhould employ Angels in his own Defence. But the Indwelling of the Godhead in Chriſt makes him not properly and literally to be the Almighty God, but only imports that God in every reſpect illuminates him and aſſiſts him, by what
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37508:43"/>Means He pleaſes, and as far as is Neceſſary for the diſcharge of that moſt eminent Office, of Redeeming Men, of Declaring and Performing the whole Will of God, Governing the Univerſe, and at the helm of the World Repreſenting God and Acting in the ſtead of God. This Indwelling of the Fulneſs of the Godhead, therefore, hind'red not but that Chriſt ſomtimes might not Know ſom things, and (when it pleaſed God, in the time of his humiliation, particularly, when for that while he was for the moſt part diveſted of the Glory which he had before the Creation of the World) might have occaſion for the Miniſtry and Aſſiſtance of Angels, tho' probably it was he, as was obſerv'd, who at firſt aſſigned to every one of the Angels their Share of the concomitant and concurrent Divine Power, which, eſpecially ſince his Exaltation, as we have ſaid, they employ according to his Directions.</p>
               <p>As to what is in fine pretended, that it ſeems marvellous, <hi>that a Creature ſhould be named before, and ſhould be ſaid to have the preheminence over, the Power of God, by the Holy Ghoſt underſtanding the Influence of the Divine Power and Divine Inſpiration;</hi> it muſt be remembred, both, that by the Divine Inſpiration or Influence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> do not underſtand a Perſon but a Property or an Act, and that, agreeably to the expreſs Doctrine of Scripture, they hold that Chriſt is made partaker of the Fulneſs of the Godhead in the manner we have ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and juſt now have further ſpecified, ſo that, for Deſiring the Father, he may at any time Diſpoſe of the Divine Power and Inſpiration, and doth actually diſpoſe thereof as is ſaid, according to what he pleaſes to ask it of God, and therefore the Holy Spirit is repreſented as proceeding from the Father by the Son, and the Holy Spirit is ſaid to be Chriſt's. Now it is not ſtrange, that the Diſpoſer ſhould be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before the thing diſpoſed of, as it is in the Form of Baptiſm. There is then no need to inſiſt any longer upon this. And ſo we have don with the ſecond <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> importing <hi>that the Aſſertions of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians are not uncredible, and that their Interpretations are rational, and agreeable to the ſtile and current of Scripture, and therefore natural and obvious enough.</hi> And this, together with the following <hi>Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,</hi> being conſidered, the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Sentiment will appear to be wholly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and inconteſtably therefore altogether incredible. For indeed is it likely, that, Chriſtianity for many Ages having been <hi>altered</hi> in many <hi>weighty</hi> Points, the preſent <hi>Trinitarian</hi> (at leaſt ſeemingly <hi>impoſſible</hi> and <hi>contradictory</hi>) Syſtem has all this while remained the ſame that it was from the beginning, and by the hands of the <hi>Platoniſts</hi> and <hi>Scholaſticks</hi> has paſſed <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>undefiled?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Summ. When ſome <hi>Texts</hi> ſeem ſuſceptible of <hi>two</hi> Senſes, <hi>the one</hi> more literal but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly irrational or contradictory &amp; impoſſible &amp; manifeſtly inconſiſtent with other Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and the Current of Scripture, and <hi>the other</hi> more ſtrained or figurative but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Scripture-Stile and reconcileable with Reaſon; <hi>which</hi> of the <hi>two</hi> Senſes do the generality of Chriſtians and in particular Proteſtants commonly prefer in their <hi>Interpretations?</hi> They unanimouſly hold, as <hi>a ſtanding Rule</hi> by which the Scripture is to be interpreted that it may be rightly underſtood, (as was ſhewn in the laſt Chapter,) That We are to reject that Senſe which is manifeſtly abſurd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with expreſs Texts, and are then to hold by that which is reconcileable to Reaſon and Scripture, tho' ſomwhat more remote from the Sound of the Words. And indeed it would evidently be moſt unreaſonable to follow other Meaſures. We
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37508:43"/>ought then, moſt inconteſtably, conſtantly to <hi>prefer</hi> that <hi>Interpretation</hi> which is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Scripture and Reaſon,</hi> before that which is <hi>inconſiſtent with both.</hi> And this Conſideration leads Us to the next Particular.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Texts</hi> inſtanced in, for the purpoſe aforeſaid, are <hi>thoſe, which</hi> either <hi>call Chriſt the Son of God by way of eminency,</hi> or <hi>ſhew that Chriſt may and is to be Pray'd to,</hi> and <hi>declare that God will have Men honour the Son even as they honour the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Texts, which call Chriſt the Son of God by way of eminency,</hi> an Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dr. <hi>Sherlocks</hi> will go a great way to give a light into that Matter. Theſe are his words, at Pages 71ſt and 72d of his Book againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter. That which entitles Creatures to the natural relation of Sonſhip to God, is to receive their being from God, in the likeneſs and reſemblance of his own Nature: Thus Angels are called the Sons of God, and ſo is Adam, who was immediately formed by God in his own Image and Likeneſs; And thus ſom think that Chriſt, who was as immediately form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a Divine Power in the Womb of the Virgin as Adam was of the Dust of the Earth, is for this reaſon called the Son of God.</hi> (See <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35, where that reaſon is expreſly given of Chriſt's being call'd <hi>the Son of God.</hi>)</p>
               <p>The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> to this Obſervation will in particular add, that no Creature was ever made in <hi>ſo great a Likeneſs and Reſemblance of the Divine Nature</hi> nor <hi>deſigned to ſo high a Dignity</hi> as Chriſt was, and that this particularly is the reaſon why Chriſt is called <hi>the Son of God by way of eminency,</hi> beſides that He is actually <hi>God's Only-Begotten Son,</hi> as we did obſerve from <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. This is a plain, and a rational, and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all, an unexceptionable account of the Matter; and therefore what Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> adds thereupon ſerves only to ſhew, that the Scholaſtick or Platonick <hi>Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Sentiment of Chriſt's Sonſhip is impoſſible. For this is certain and undeniable; and yet, if the Platonick or Scholaſtick Sentiment were true, this could not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of, according to that Syſtem, for he ſays that Syſtem implies, that, there being but one Son in Chriſt, it is Hereſy to hold that Chriſt is the Son of God in any other ſenſe than by an Eternal Generation.</p>
               <p>Chriſt, as we have ſeen, is called <hi>the Only-Begotten Son of God,</hi> becauſe he is <hi>the only Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom God cauſed to be born of a Woman without the help of Man:</hi> And in that ſenſe he is
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:37508:44"/>
                  <hi>God's Only Son,</hi> as well as in this reſpect that he is <hi>the only Lord whom God has placed at the head of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, and to whom he has ſubjected all Creatures;</hi> For <hi>Soveraigns</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> are called <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> (<hi>Luk.</hi> 1.32. <hi>John</hi> 1.49. &amp;c.) as is ſhewn in the <hi>Introduction</hi> of Dr. <hi>Patrick's Witneſſes of Chriſtianity,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> is <hi>the On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soveraign and King who is conſtituted the Lord of all other created Lords and Kings,</hi> in which reſpect <hi>he</hi> is <hi>like to God,</hi> which we have (not well) tranſlated <hi>equal to God,</hi> as alſo in reſpect of the exerciſe of the Divine Power in working the greateſt Miracles whenever be pleaſed and whenever he will. Som People are apt to imagin, that even God being called <hi>the Father,</hi> is a valid Proof of more Perſons than One in the Divine Nature. But ſeriouſly do they think, that <hi>the Samaritan Women,</hi> and <hi>common Soldiers,</hi> were acquainted with the <hi>Scholaſtick</hi> or <hi>Platonick Trinity?</hi> Yet <hi>theſe</hi> ſpeak of a <hi>Son of God,</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 27.54.) and to <hi>the other</hi> our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeaks of <hi>the Father</hi> as of Somwhat intelligible to them. (<hi>John</hi> 4.21.) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude we then, that by <hi>the Father</hi> we muſt underſtand <hi>God</hi> the Common Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of his Creatures, and that by <hi>the Son</hi> or <hi>a Son of God</hi> in general we muſt underſtand <hi>a Child of God,</hi> a good Man by excellency, or one extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily belov'd of God. <hi>Act.</hi> 4, 27.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Texts,</hi> which are ſaid to <hi>ſhew that Chriſt is to be Pray'd to;</hi> (no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing need abſolutely be added to what has been repreſented by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> upon this Subject; howbeit, the Reader is to be reminded,) <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> give a very fair account of theſe Texts; for it is evident that thoſe Texts either import that Believers are now <hi>denominated by the Name of Chriſt,</hi> and look for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thro' his Redemption and Mediation and <hi>plead in that Name with Almighty God</hi> in daily Prayers, or elſe they ſet forth only the <hi>Wiſhes</hi> of zealous Souls in a pious Diſcourſe or Epiſtle, &amp; not in the Solemnity of a regular Prayer, or they are inſtances of Men asking ſome favour of Chriſt when he was ſeen preſent and appear'd to be ſpoken to, or they may inconteſtably be interpreted in another Senſe than that which they are alledged for; as the 15th. Verſe of the 72d. <hi>Pſalm</hi> which literally is ſpoken of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and which in the Verſion of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> in <hi>the Common-Prayer Book</hi> is tranſlated, <hi>Prayer ſhall be made unto him,</hi> but in the Verſion in <hi>the Bible</hi> thus, <hi>Prayer ſhall be made for him.</hi> In a word, no one Text can be produced, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly requiring, that generally Chriſtians here upon Earth ſince Chriſt's Aſcenſion ſhould directly Pray to him in Heaven, &amp; ſhould not fail to do it regularly &amp; conſtantly.</p>
               <p>Indeed, as was ſaid, the Generality of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> hold that Chriſt <hi>may</hi> be Prayed to, tho' not as being expreſly or properly God Almighty himſelf, (<hi>Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves, on <hi>Col</hi> 1.16. being properly <hi>a Man,</hi>) yet as being our Interceſſor with God, and as being the Vicegerent of the Univerſe, and the Mighty Prince, who moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently repreſents God, who in the ſtead of God and next to God commands to all Creatures, who under God diſpoſes of all things and can do all things, in whom God dwells, who is moſt intimately united with God, and whom God continually directs and aſſiſts.</p>
               <p>What the <hi>Papiſts</hi> groundleſly pretend and aſſert of <hi>the Saints</hi> in Heaven, and of <hi>the Holy Angels,</hi> is inconteſtably true of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> He is <hi>our Mediator</hi> with God, and, we may think, ſeeing <hi>God dwells in him,</hi> he <hi>ſees in God all things neceſſary for him to know.</hi> Howbeit, undoubtedly, <hi>it is ſufficient to Pray in his Name to God;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:37508:44"/>in ſo doing, <hi>we recommend the ſubject of our Prayers to him,</hi> founding all our Expectations on the Acceptableneſs of <hi>his Mediation with God;</hi> and, at the ſame time, <hi>we diſcharge our Duty to God,</hi> acknowledging that our Mediator and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory King holds all his Power and Soveraignty in Subordination to God, and from God's Bounty and Munificence. (<hi>The Lords Supper</hi> is a Feaſt upon Chriſt's Sacrifice, a Commemorating of it with Thankfulneſs, and a Renewing of our Engagements in the Goſpel-Covenant with Almighty God, in order to our partaking of the Merit of Chriſt's Death, which we humbly preſent to and plead with God in that Holy Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But this doth not neceſſarily imply a direct &amp; proper Worſhip of or Prayer to Chriſt, but only a Religious Addreſs to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>The Feaſts upon the Sacrifices</hi> were Common both among <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but they did not imply an Adoration of or Prayer to the Victim that had been offer'd. Here indeed it would undoubtedly be moſt proper to Sing Hymns in Praiſe of Chriſt; but it is certain this Solemn Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val doth not abſolutely require expreſs Prayers to Chriſt.) There being then no expreſs Injunction for Men <hi>directly and conſtantly</hi> to Pray to Chriſt, and certainly therefore it being not abſolutely neceſſary, it follows that in our <hi>Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> we may content our ſelves to direct the Body or Current of our <hi>Prayers to God in the Name and thro' the Mediation of Chriſt,</hi> and to addreſs a few ſhort Ejaculari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Chriſt as has been ſaid. And <hi>thereby</hi> certainly We both make that Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt God and Chriſt that is to be made, and acquit our ſelves of our Duty to each of them in this Matter. For <hi>hereby</hi> we acknowledg the Father to be the Chief Director, the Fountain of Wiſdom and Power and Honour, the Eternal Lord, of himſelf God and King, and always ſitting the moſt Supreme at the helm, and moſt principally ſteering the Univerſe; and we acknowledg the Son to be both our Mediator with God, and the Aſſociate to the Empire of Heaven and Earth, or the Univerſal Governor under God, and conſtituted King of Men and Angels, commanding to and diſpoſing of all Creatures, as he is directed by the Divine Wiſdom, and aſſiſted by the Divine Power, dwelling in him, annexed to him, and intimately united with his Soul or Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>No more</hi> can be ſhewen to be requir'd of us. And it cannot but be very unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to find ſault with the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> for <hi>this</hi> Worſhip which they pay to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; or to declaim againſt them, as Idolaters, for ſerving ſuch a Creature, and putting their truſt in ſuch a Man.</p>
               <p>It is evident, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> do not look on our Lord Jeſus Chriſt as a mere Man; and they have good reaſon to eſteem him as a Creature that is Able to Save, ſeeing the Scripture repreſents him as ſuch a Creature as is ſufficiently endued with Divine Power to that end.</p>
               <p>And do not the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> believe Chriſt to be ſuch a Creature? Do they not believe Chriſt to be a Man? Do they not confeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the Fleſh? (1 <hi>John,</hi> 4.3.) That this Jeſus was a Man approved of God, by Miracles, which God did by him? (<hi>Acts,</hi> 2.22.) That this Man, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous,</hi> (1 <hi>John,</hi> 2.2.) was ſet forth to be a Propitiation, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25.) bare our Sins in his own Body, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24.) and ſhed for us upon the Croſs his moſt Innocent Blood, thro' which we have Redemption, (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7.) by which we are redeemed to God, (<hi>Revel.</hi> 5.9.) and by which we are waſhed, (<hi>Revel.</hi> 1.5.) and ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?

That him, who was Slain and who Hanged on a Tree and whom God Raiſed from the Dead, has God Exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour? (<hi>Acts,</hi> 5.31.)

(<hi>Acts,</hi> 13.38.) That, having been Obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs, therefore God has given him a Name which is above every Name, that at the Name of Jeſus every Knee ſhould Bow? (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10.) Do not the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> believe, that as the firſt Man <hi>Adam</hi> was made a living Soul, ſo the Second Man, the laſt <hi>Adam,</hi> who was formed by God and had God only for his Father, has been made a quickning Spirit, Power thus having been committed to him to raiſe the Dead and do all that God doth? (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45.) Do they not, in fine, know, that God will judge the World in righteouſneſs, by that Man? (<hi>Acts,</hi> 17.31.)</p>
               <p>And will the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> renounce <hi>that Man,</hi> their Saviour; and reject their Lord, their Judge, their Redeemer? Will they ſlight <hi>this Man,</hi> will they not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, whom God has appointed to reign with himſelf, whom the Angels wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and who, becauſe he was Slain, has been accounted worthy to receive Power, and Wiſdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bleſſing? (<hi>Revel.</hi> 5.12)</p>
               <p>If they think it not unfit, to honour <hi>this Man,</hi> to reverence <hi>this Man,</hi> to bow the knee to <hi>this Man,</hi> as God has appointed it; then they ſerve a Creature, and worſhip a Creature, and conſequently uſe an Inferior religious Worſhip, as well as the <hi>

               <p>The Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the ſame time <hi>Worſhipped God and King David,</hi> and were blameleſs. (1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.20.) And ſhall Chriſtians be blamed for worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God</hi> and <hi>the King whom God has ſet over the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> when Men every Day fall down before Earthly Kings and ask Petitions of them?</p>
               <p>The <hi>

Would you then think it unfit, to call upon <hi>ſuch a Prince,</hi> or to ask Grace and Salvation of <hi>Him,</hi> for the ſake of his precious Death and Paſſion? Or do you think that He, <hi>to whom all Power is given,</hi> and the Spirit without meaſure, and in whom the Father moſt intimatelydwells, is not able to know your Wants and to hear your Requeſts? To worſhip Chriſt, is then in ſome meaſure to worſhip God; ſince Chriſt not only is a God, or Soveraign, the King of Heaven and Earth under God, and not only acts moſt eminently for God, ſo as moſt eminently to repreſent God; but Chriſt is the true <hi>Schechina,</hi> the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conſtantly dwells in him, and <hi>all Power is given unto him;</hi> He is then hon'red to the Glory of God, by God's Order, and (ſo) God, as was ſaid. is worſhipped in him: There is then but one God, properly, that is religiouſly worſhipped, tho' Chriſt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37508:45"/>be called God, and be worſhiped to the Glory of God. (In all the Dominions of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> there is but one <hi>Soveraign,</hi> tho' a Subject in the Iſle of <hi>Man</hi> bears alſo the Title of <hi>Soveraign,</hi> and tho' the Viceroy in <hi>Ireland</hi> repreſents the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> and be <hi>honoured as the Soveraign.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Indeed the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> that did not Pray at all to Chriſt, when they own'd him to be the Governor of the World under God, had not ſufficiently weighed the laſt quoted Text, of <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. (where all Power is ſaid to have been given to Chriſt,) nor had fully conſider'd, that the Father, who dwelleth in Chriſt, can enable him to do all things, and that, therefore, now at leaſt, Chriſt is ſuch an excellent Creature, (as the <hi>Arians</hi> hold him to have been from the beginning, namely) as has, himſelf, incomparably more Perfections and Power, than all the other Creatures together. They needed then no more have doubted that Chriſt can Know and Supply the Needs of Men, in the Rank and Order that He is ſet, than they would have queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd that a Mother can Take care of her Family. I know not therefore that there be now any <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian,</hi> that do not Pray to and Worſhip (the Saviour of the World, the Lord of Men &amp; Angels,) the Man Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>in the manner I have ſpecified,</hi> namely, <hi>in a ſubordinate degree to God,</hi> honouring him <hi>as the King of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe under God,</hi> &amp; <hi>as be, that governs &amp; diſpoſes all things under God's Direction, as well as mediates for Men &amp; intercedes with God,</hi> who is ſtill to be held and ever muſt neceſſarily be lookt upon as the Supream. (<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> then can no more be accounted <hi>Idolaters</hi> for <hi>thus</hi> worſhipping Chriſt, than <hi>Iriſh-Men</hi> can be ſaid to be <hi>Rebels</hi> for honouring their Viceroy <hi>as they do.</hi>)</p>
               <p>Chriſt then being thus Call'd upon, nothing is aſcribed to him that is inconſiſtent with the Unity of God; <hi>a Man</hi> is not Worſhipped <hi>as God,</hi> but <hi>as aſſiſted of God,</hi> and <hi>moſt highly exalted</hi> by God; and Truſt is not put in <hi>a mere Creature,</hi> but in <hi>one abundantly aſſiſted of the Divine Nature:</hi> That is, therefore, <hi>ultimately</hi> and <hi>properly,</hi> to put our Truſt in <hi>the God-head</hi> dwelling <hi>in Christ.</hi> And the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> account the Worſhip of Chriſt <hi>a Religious Worſhip,</hi> no otherwiſe than <hi>as it is intended and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the Glory of the Father, as Chriſts acts for God at the Helm of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, and as the Divine Nature aſſiſts him, dwells in him, is as intimately united with him as poſſble, and is made in a manner Part of his Being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And is it not thus, that the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> themſelves adore God, and worſhip Chriſt? (And then where is the Great Difference, or the Great Fault and Defect of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Syſtem?) Would they adore God, as the Human Nature of Chriſt? Or would they <hi>(the Trinitarians)</hi> worſhip Chriſt's Human Nature, as God? The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians</hi> worſhip or honour <hi>the Man Jeſus Chriſt, as the moſt Dignified Creature,</hi> and as moſt intimately United to God; and <hi>God, as the Supream Being.</hi> The <hi>Trinitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> cannot <hi>reaſonably</hi> do <hi>otherwiſe.</hi> And they cannot deny, that to honour Chriſt, (as has been ſaid the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> do,) is to honour God, and not to give his Glory to Another. Indeed, to honour a Being that God has not appointed to be honoured, is to diſhonour God. But, inconteſtably, to honour one <hi>whom God has commanded us to honour, to the Glory of God;</hi> is to glorify and ſerve God in that Particular, and ſo to worſhip God: And God, dwelling in Chriſt, as he doth, as has been ſhewn, is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and worſhipped in Chriſt, by his own Appointment, as already ſaid.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>John,</hi> 5.23. declaring it to be the Will of God, <hi>That Men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father;</hi> an Equality of Honour is no more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37508:46"/>to be imagined to be intended and required here, than an Equality of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in thoſe Words, <hi>Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfect, Mat.</hi> 5, 48, or an Equality of Fear and Trembling before mortal and earthly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as before the King of Men and Angels in this Text, <hi>Servants be Obedient to them that are your Maſters according to the Fleſh, with Fear and Trembling, in Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſs of your Heart, as unto Christ.</hi> Epheſ. 6.5.</p>
               <p>The Senſe of this Verſe of the 6th. of the <hi>Epheſians</hi> is, that as we would ſtand in aw before the King of Kings, ſo, in proportion of the Subordination, Servants ought to demean themſelves before their Maſters. The Senſe of the Text of the 5th. of St. <hi>Mathew</hi> is, that as God is truly perfect, ſo we ought effectually to ſtrive to be perfect with that Perfection which our Natures are capable of. And, in like manner, the Senſe of the 23d. Verſ. of the 5th. of St. <hi>John</hi> is, that as we honour God, we muſt alſo honour his Deputy &amp; Vicegerent, tho' nevertheleſs the one as (properly) God's Chief Miniſter, as was ſaid, &amp; the other as (expreſly) the Almighty himſelf. The Kings of <hi>England</hi> may uſe the ſame <hi>Phraſe,</hi> to declare it their Will &amp; Pleaſure, <hi>That the Subjects in Ireland ſhould honour the Viceroy, even as they honour the King.</hi> But that doth not imply, that the one muſt abſolutely be taken for the other, &amp; conſequently that is not to give the Supreme Royal Glory itſelf to the Viceroy, no more than to honour Chriſt is to give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly God's Supreme Glory to Another, as the <hi>Arians</hi> do well obſerve, beſides that the Saying that God will not give his Glory to Another, may ſignify, that He will not give it to be diſpos'd of, (that He will not give the diſpoſition of it to Another, or that He will not give to Another that Glory which is peculiar to Him of diſpoſing of religious Honour, and appointing Rites <hi>of Religion,</hi>) or that He will not give or impart a Sublime (Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly) Honour to Strangers or Aliens from Him, neither will give his Praiſe to Idols, that is, He will not patiently ſuffer, or allow, that Men ſhould make to themſelves Objects of Religious Service at their Pleaſure like the Heathens, &amp; that the Religious Worſhip which is properly &amp; ultimately due to Him ſhould be paid to Unfit Beings, to Stocks &amp; Stones or to Daemons, which are not truly (in any, holy, ſcriptural, ſenſe) <hi>Gods,</hi> being neither <hi>the Supreme God,</hi> nor <hi>Soveraign Officers of God,</hi> commiſſionated with Power &amp; Authority <hi>thus to act for God,</hi> ſo as moſt eminently to repreſent god, and, ſo, to receive a Suitable Honour, appointed to terminate ultimately to God: So that God then doth not give properly <hi>the Religious</hi> Honour to <hi>Another,</hi> tho' He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to bow the Knee to the Man Jeſus Chriſt, as we do to God. If He pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, He might ſet Angels over Us, or any Good Spirits, and command Us to bow to them, and ask and receive Graces of them, tho' his Holy Nature cannot permit him to give any ſuch Glory to his Enemies, or ever to allow that Impure Spirits be ſought to and reverenced. That could not redound to God's Glory, or the Good of his Creatures; whereas the other might. (See a Paſſage of St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s, quoted in the 1ſt. Part of Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Sermon, on <hi>Pſ.</hi> 86.5. where St. <hi>Gregery</hi> obſerves, that <hi>Angels</hi> were <hi>Worſhipped</hi> under <hi>the Old Teſtament.</hi> But, if ſo, yet, to be ſure, not only that was not a Divine Worſhip, but even that Worſhip, ſo far as it extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was for the ſake of, and terminated to, God, whoſe Immediate and Higheſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Meſſengers the Angels then appeared to be; and, ſo, that hindred not but it might truly be ſaid, that God alone was properly Worſhipped.) The Text, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.8. which we tranſlate doing Service to them which <hi>By Nature</hi> are no Gods, may
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:37508:46"/>be tranſlated, <hi>doing Service to them which</hi> TRUELY <hi>are no Gods,</hi> (yet it is the ſame, if we read, <hi>Of their Nature,</hi>) whether <hi>Supreme,</hi> according to the proper and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent ſenſe of the word, or <hi>Inferiour, of God's creating and conſtituting,</hi> according to the Scripture-Stile. See <hi>Grotius</hi> on the Place. Certainly, we are expreſly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in Scripture, <hi>to Serve the Man Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (<hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9.) Yet, inconteſtably, <hi>the Man</hi> Jeſus Chriſt properly is <hi>a God</hi> but <hi>in an inferiour ſenſe.</hi> We are then, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, to ſerve the Man Jeſus Chriſt as <hi>ſuch</hi> a God, <hi>appointed</hi> and <hi>dignified</hi> by the Supreme and Eternal God, (<hi>Act.</hi> 2.36,) and we are to ſerve the Supreme God, as abſolutely being the Supreme God, or as Him who is <hi>of himſelf God</hi> and who (conſequently) is God in the moſt proper and eminent ſenſe of that word.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, this doth not imply that Chriſt is not as intimately united with the Divine Nature as poſſible. For all Power is given him in Heaven and Earth, and, acting for God in the higheſt Poſt, he repreſents God at the Helm of the Univerſe. But a Creature cannot thus repreſent God, and govern the World, and have all Power given it; except God be with it, and aſſiſt and direct it, ſo as that that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have the enjoyment and diſpoſition of the Divine Nature as of it's own Being, whereby it's Power and Underſtanding being enlarged it may in a high meaſure Know and Act as God. And accordingly, as <hi>Sandius</hi> obſerves, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> held, from the Beginning of Chriſtianity, that an Influence of the Divine Nature was incarnated in and moſt ſtrictly united with the Man Chriſt Jeſus. So that Chriſt is not Worſhipped, neither is God's Repreſentative, or the Father's Univerſal Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, merely as he is a Creature. A mere Creature cannot comprehend in it's Thoughts and under it's Care the whole Univerſe, and can never be ſuch a Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the Father's at the Helm of the Univerſal Government. Nor can a mere Creature be Worſhipped by all the Creatures in the Univerſe, as Chriſt by God's Appointment is to be. It ſeems, God neither can nor will be thus repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any Creature as a Creature. Chriſt then is God's Repreſentative, and is Worſhipped, in his Mediatory Kingdom over the whole Univerſe, Inaſmuch as an Influence of the Divine Nature moſt intimately Dwells in him, Aſſiſts and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects him, and Worketh in and by him, and Inaſmuch as the Divine Majeſty is Conſpicuous in him, and As by his Interceſſion and by the Merit of his Death and the Vertue of the Covenant of Grace and of his Union with God and his Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he Diſpoſes of the Divine Power in the Goſpel-Oeconomy.</p>
               <p>A mere Creature may have a vaſt Honor and Power; but not like that which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in Chriſt in his Government of the Univerſe. Whereas God has given us two Eyes whereby we may perceive three or four Objects at a time at a certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and two Ears which may imperfectly diſcern ſome few (ſeveral) Sounds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo at the ſame time as the Sounds of certain (ſeveral) Voices and of ſome Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and two Hands by which we may take hold of ſeveral Particies of Matter and ſtrike ten Strings at a time and move a certain Maſs and ſteer a Ship, and but a narrow Underſtanding according to the preſent Needs and the Capacity of our bodily Organs; God might give a freer Carrier to our Spirits, and endue us with more noble and vaſter Capaeities, and give us two hundred or two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Hands and Ears and Eyes, and enable our Souls to uſe them all fitly in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to ſo many ſeveral Objects in the ſame inſtant, and conſequently vaſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37508:47"/>the Natural Underſtanding in order to it's forming at the ſame time ſo many Thoughts and Conceptions. It may be that an Angel, or a Human Soul, in a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Body, has greater Capacities than we conceive, and is all Hands and Eyes and Fars and Tongues, and can clearly diſcern and hear and diſcourſe and act upon a whole Nation. But, after all, a finite Creature, with the mere Strength of a Creature, cannot comprehend the Univerſe. Therefore an Angel or a Human Spirit cannot have all Power given him, except God be with and in him in the manner aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, God may ſet up particular Kings in particular Places, and give them vaſt Dominions, and oblige their Subjects to be uncovered in their Preſence and to bow the knee before them. But, in order that <hi>at the Name of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, of Things in Heaven and Things in Earth, and Things under the Earth,</hi> and that Chriſt may be enabled to receive theſe Homages and to govern the Univerſe and diſpoſe fitly of all Creatures; it is neceſſary that the Divine Majeſty and Power and Wiſdom be with and in this Man in the manner aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>Thus all the Lines of a Circle terminate to an individual Point in the Center. A Spider, circumſcribed by and fixed in a Place, teaches of its ſelf no further than that Place; but when it has weaved it's Web, it may by the Means of thoſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Threads act at a Diſtance from it's ſelf and above it's own Power. A Man with a Teleſcope pierces the Skies, and diſcovers undiſcerned Stars. All this and infinitely more is the Divinity to the Man Jeſus Chriſt. He is in the Center of God, and the Godhead is to him an infinite Circle, all the Lines whereof as far as is neceſſary act upon him and uphold him, and ſo he acts thereby. The Influence of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, dwelling in Chriſt, and extending it ſelf all over the Univerſe, is the mighty Teleſcope whereby Chriſt ſees all things, and the infinite Web by which he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to act every where. And this acting is to be aſcribed to him, as well as to God, or the Father, and to him, in this reſpect, primarily, or chiefly, inaſmuch as God doth all things, in the Chriſtian Oeconomy, upon Chriſt's Account, and at his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Indeed, Chriſt wills nothing but what God wills: But, then, God is pleas'd and willing now to do many things for the Sake of Chriſt, and through his Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which He would not have done, if it had not been for his Undertaking, and his free and wonderful Condeſcenſion and Humiliation for the Race of Mankind, and the Merit of his Death, and the Covenant of Grace purchaſed by his Blood, and his continual Interceſſion at the right hand of the Majeſty on high. Thus, God and Chriſt are to be conſidered, and ſought to, and honoured, and worſhipped; and the Diſtinction, that is to be made between them, is evident. God is <hi>of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> God, and his Dominion is ever the moſt Supreme, and thus He is to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. And Chriſt receives all things of God, and his Kingdom is a Mediatory Kingdom, and he is thus to be Worſhipped. And this is the <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Notion of <hi>Chriſt's Divinity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Heathens were particularly Criminal in theſe 3 reſpects. (1.) They ſet up, <hi>of their own Heads and without any Warrant or Command,</hi> ſome <hi>Mediators</hi> and ſome <hi>Symbols</hi> and <hi>Schechinas,</hi> which they worſhipped, with likewiſe deviſed &amp; ſtrange Rites, and they made the Chiefeſt Part of their Religion to conſiſt in the Worſhip of theſe, they had ſuch a vaſt Number of them. (2.) They ſet up <hi>many Supreme Gods.</hi> Yet (3.) They <hi>paſſed by the true God,</hi> and worſhipped Creatures, and many of them Moſt
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37508:47"/>Vicious &amp; Wicked Creatures, for their <hi>Supreme Gods.</hi> Which is the Meaning of <hi>Gal.</hi> 4, 8, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 25. Whereby Religion became perfectly corrupted and unfit to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy Men, and actually did as much harm as it was deſigned to do good. Wherefore <hi>God</hi> would be own'd for <hi>the Only true God,</hi> and requir'd to be <hi>Serv'd</hi> and Obey'd <hi>as ſuch,</hi> &amp; (ſo) willed that Men ſhould not introduce any thing in his Service, but what they had expreſs Warrant for, from Him, either by the Light of Nature or the Light of Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Revelation. And that is the Meaning of <hi>Deut.</hi> 6, 13. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 4, 10. But all this hinders not, but that, tho' God is the Only Abſolute and Independent Being who Only is to be Served as ſuch and who Only is to be Worſhipped with Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate or Divine Worſhip and who Only is the Fountain of Honour ſo that None beſides Him ought to be Honoured but Thoſe whom He Honours, yet, for all that, Others, beſides God, may, when God pleaſes, be Served and Honoured, in an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Degree, Relatively and in Obedience to God, and ſo to his Glory and He may appoint a Mediator thro' whom We may come to Him. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.18. <hi>John</hi> 20, 31, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11. <hi>God requiring</hi> it <hi>in order to his Glory,</hi> and <hi>ſo it being done to that intent,</hi> that <hi>is actually to glorify God,</hi> and <hi>ſo is not to give his Glory to Another</hi> but to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Himſelf Only being ultimately ſerved thereby.</hi> See the (aforequoted) 18th Chap. of the 5th Book of <hi>Limborch's Theologia Chriſtiana,</hi> §. 10. and an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, intituled, <hi>A Vindication of the Worſhip of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> P. 23, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We may then inconteſtably Serve and Honour our Lord Jeſus Chriſt as our Mediator and Mediatory King, as was ſaid, tho' God Only is to be Served and Honoured as the Moſt Supreme and as the Eternal Fountain of Honour.</p>
               <p>At the 11. Ve. of the 2. Ch. of the <hi>Phil.</hi> as we have intimated, the Apoſtle ſhews expreſly how that Matter ought to be diſtinguiſhed, when he ſays, that it is God's Will we ſhould honour and worſhip our Saviour, and ſubject our ſelves to him, and own him as our Lord, <hi>viz. to the Glory of God the Father.</hi> So that, as was ſaid, it is evident the Honour we are to give to Chriſt, is <hi>a Mediatory or Inferior Honour,</hi> and is not ultimately to terminate on him, but on the Father, for whole Sake and at whoſe Command the ſaid Honour is paid. Howbeit, tho' the Worſhip of Chriſt be not properly the Moſt Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, yet it may be termed a Divine Worſhip, in that Senſe that Chriſt is ſaid to be God. (We muſt needs then obſerve, with St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> concerning the difficult or figurative Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture, that they are to be underſtood with Reaſon, or in a reaſonable ſenſe. <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All Soveraigns are jealous of their Honour; the Soveraigns of <hi>Great Britain</hi> would not endure that <hi>Wro-would</hi> of their Subjects ſhould have Guards, or ſhould be ſerved Kneeling: Yet they free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow it to their Lieutenant or Deputy, becauſe the Glory of it terminates to them.

And thus the Scripture teaches We are to Honour our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as one to and upon whom the higheſt Dignity, Glory and Power, that can be beſtowed upon one in Commiſſion, has been <hi>in that manner</hi> confer'd and granted, Namely, <hi>to the Glory of the Donor and Diſpoſer of it.</hi> And this leads us to the laſt Particular, that we have undertaken to ſpeak to, which is this.</p>

               <p n="1">I. The firſt Argument I ſhall mention, ſhall be the laſt quoted Paſſage of the 2d Chap. of the <hi>Philippians,</hi> where the Apoſtle declares, that We are to own Jeſus Chriſt as one <hi>exalted</hi> and <hi>made Lord,</hi> and that we are <hi>thus</hi> to honour him, <hi>to the Glory of God the Father:</hi> So that, as was ſaid, the Honour we are to pay to Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt is not to terminate ultimately on him, but on the Father, for whoſe Sake and at whoſe Command the ſaid Honour is given to <hi>the Lord Chriſt,</hi> upon the account of his Exaltation as the ineſtimable Reward of his Obedience, and upon the account of the moſt High Commiſſion granted to him by God. Now who doth not ſee, that this invincibly demonſtrates, that properly <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not <hi>God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> For if he were literally God Almighty himſelf, it would be abſurd, not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore and honour him for himſelf ultimately; for that would imply, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature is not to be honour'd for it's own ſake. It were in vain to alledg, that the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> hold the Son has received his Divine Nature from the Father, &amp; that ſo they may alſo worſhip him to the Glory of the Father. They ſay, that the Son had the Divine Nature eternally, and not by a free Gift, but by abſolute Neceſſity, and that it is the ſame numerical Divine Nature and Eſſence with that of the Father, ſo that he is as much God, and is as neceſſarily ſo, as the Father; from which Principles therefore it would need follow, that the Son ſhould be honour'd ultimately for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or, which is the ſame, ſhould be honoured with properly Divine Honour, as well as the Father. Then, if things had been ſo, the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid, We muſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Chriſt's Human Nature, or the Man Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>to the Glory of God the Son.</hi> But the Apoſtle doth not preſent us with any ſuch Notions. But he tells us, that Jeſus Chriſt is to be own'd as a Lord, and the greateſt Lord, under God, and is thus to be honoured, <hi>to the Glory of God the Father.</hi> What can be more expreſs? If the Son be literally God Almighty, <hi>he cannot be exalted</hi> any higher, and <hi>he muſt needs be honoured ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately for himſelf,</hi> with (Supreme) Divine Honour. But, ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exalted him,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas, if the Son had been himſelf literally God, his whole Perſon muſt needs have ſat neceſſarily at the Helm of the Univerſe, as well as the Perſon of the Father, and it could not have been otherwiſe, except a Divine Perſon could have ceaſed to be properly Divine, that is to ſay, except God could have been annihilated. Now, the Reader may pleaſe to make an application of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37508:48"/>this, as well as the following Arguments, to Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Rule, mentioned before, and by which he owns this Controverſy is to be tried.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The Second Argument ſhall be that, which the Dr. at the 197th and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Pages of his Book, intituled, <hi>The Scripture Proofs of our Saviour's Divinity explained and vindicated,</hi> has carefully pointed out to us, and taken great pains to prepare for us, and make us ſenſible of it's great weight. And indeed it ſeems a moſt expreſs and deciſive Argument. It is that which is grounded on the 36th Verſe of the 24th Chap. of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> to which the 32d Verſe of the 13th of St. <hi>Mark</hi> is parallel; the import whereof is, <hi>That, Chriſt declaring he did not know what God knew Namely, when ſhould be the Day of Judgment, it follows neceſſari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y and moſt manifeſtly that he is not God himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dr. in the Place aforequoted, repreſents the force of the Argument in theſe words. <q>There is an obvious Objection againſt the perfect intuitive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Saviour, from what he himſelf tells us concerning the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Jeriſalem,</hi> &amp;c.—For were he true and perfect God, of the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with his Father, he could be ignorant of nothing.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now how doth the Dr. ſolve this <hi>Objection,</hi> as he calls it? <q>The common Anſwer to this,</q> ſays he, <q>is, by diſtinguiſhing between the Knowledge of Chriſt, as God, and as. Man: That tho' as God he knew all things, yet there were ſome Secrets for ſome time concealed from his Human Nature.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Well! Doth the Dr. know of ſome better Solution? No. Is he then very well ſatisfied with this <hi>common Anſwer?</hi> No. He neither likes this, nor can tell what to ſay more ſatisfactory. Theſe are his words. "The common Anſwer to this, is, &amp;c. as was ſaid in the foregoing Paragraph: "And this," ſays he, <q>muſt be the true Anſwer, or I know not how we ſhall find a better; and yet it ſeems ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard, that the Son, who is but one Perſon, tho' he have two Natures, ſhould be ſaid not to know that, which he did know, whether he knew it as God, or as Man. This I confeſs is a Difficulty, and always will be ſo, while we know ſo little of this Perſonal Union,</q> that is to ſay, of the Union of the Godhead with the Man Chriſt Jeſus. But then, Dr! if we know ſo little of it, why do you call it a <hi>Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> and that <hi>of an eternal Son,</hi> or an eternal Perſon, <hi>with the Spirit of Chriſt?</hi> But ſince you are pleas'd to call it ſo, you muſt ſtand to it, and muſt not pretend to evade, by ſaying you know not how far it goes, or what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications the Human Nature of Chriſt receives from its Union with the Godhead. This is not the Point, nor is it at all to the buſineſs in hand, from which you ought by no means to be ſuffered now to flinch away, when it manifeſtly appears to be againſt you and invincibly ſhews the ſolidity of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Sentiment. For you have ſaid, and the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Syſtem expreſly aſſerts, that the whole Son is but one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and therefore, tho' you know not exactly how great are the Communications of the ſeveral Parts betwixt themſelves, which conſtitute this one Perſon, yet you muſt own that thoſe Communications muſt needs go ſo far as to make of it but <hi>one Perſon.</hi> (Even all that paſs for Orthodox, among the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> acknowledge, that Chriſt is but one Perſon and but one Son.) Now the buſineſs is to conſider, Whether any thing can be <hi>in general terms denied</hi> of <hi>one Son,</hi> or of <hi>one Perſon,</hi> which yet is <hi>true of ſome Part of that Perſon?</hi> And the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> maintain, that, upon the conſidering of it, this ought not to be found a mere <hi>Difficulty</hi> againſt the <hi>Trinitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:37508:49"/>Syſtem, but an <hi>irrefragable Argument</hi> of the truth of the Syſtem of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The two following Conſiderations are the utmoſt that the Dr. offers, in order, as he ſays, to give a light to this Matter; in ſo much that if both of them are invalid to ſolve the Difficulty, it will appear that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Argument is demonſtrative and irreſiſtible.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Reflection is this. That, <q>notwithſtanding the Union, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Human Natures are two diſtinct Natures in Chriſt; and therefore he may be ignorant of that as Man, which he knows as God.</q> Now ſuppoſing that Poſſible with the Dr. yet this makes nothing at all to the purpoſe of the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> except our Saviour had thus expreſſed himſelf: The Son, as Man, does not know that thing which you deſire him to inform you of, and therefore, as Man, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not inform you of it, and, as God, he will not tell it you, tho', as God he knows it very well. But every one, who can read our Saviour's words in the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, may ſoon ſee whether they bear any ſuch diſtinction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The 2d. Reflection, more to the purpoſe, is, That the God incarnate, that is to ſay, Chriſt, <q>being but one Perſon, whatever belongs to either Nature, may true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be <hi>afformed</hi> of his Perſon, with reſpect to that Nature to which it belongs, tho' it be not true of him, with reſpect to his other Nature; <hi>and,</hi> thus, <hi>therefore,</hi> (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the Dr.) if Chriſt, as Man, was ignorant of any thing, which he knew as God, he might truely be <hi>ſaid, not</hi> to know, what he did not know as Man: this (ſays the Dr.) is univerſally owned.</q> Now, Dr. this is a groſs Miſtake, and, moſt notoriouſly, your <hi>inſerence</hi> is abſolutely <hi>wrong,</hi> and is ſo far from being univerſally owned, that it is indeed owned by no body in the World that conſiders, but the contrary is held by all Men.</p>
               <p>It is true, that <hi>what belongs to any Part of a Perſon,</hi> may be <hi>affirmed</hi> of that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with reſpect to that Part to which it belongs, tho' it be not true of him, with reſpect to his other Parts. For inſtance. If a Man be <hi>Wounded in the Arm,</hi> it may truly be ſaid of <hi>that Man,</hi> that <hi>he is Wounded,</hi> tho' he be not Wounded in the Head nor Legg. In like manner. If Chriſt be both the Supreme God and a Man. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally-United, <hi>he</hi> may be <hi>ſaid in general</hi> to know that, which he knows as God, tho' as Man he know not that thing.</p>
               <p>But becauſe what belongs to any one certain Part of a Perſon, may be <hi>affirmed</hi> of that Perſon, with reſpect to that Part to which it belongs, tho' it be not true of him with reſpect to his other Parts; it <hi>doth not follow,</hi> that <hi>what doth not belong to one certain Part of his,</hi> may <hi>in general terms</hi> be <hi>denied</hi> of his Perſon, when yet it truly belongs to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Part of him. <hi>That is ſo far from being to be inferred from the former way of ſpeaking, that every one knows it to be falſe,</hi> that what truly belongs to one Part of a Perſon, may <hi>in general terms</hi> be <hi>denied</hi> of that Perſon, upon the account that it belongs not to ſome other Part of his. Tho' a Man be not Wounded in the Head or Legg, it will not, <hi>in general terms,</hi> be ſaid that <hi>he</hi> is <hi>not Wounded,</hi> when actually he is Wounded in the Arm. Such a <hi>denial,</hi> upon this mental reſervation that the Man is not Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Legg, would be looked upon as a ſhameful Equivocation &amp; an expreſs Lye. And would the Dr. aſcribe to his Saviour <hi>ſuch</hi> a way of reaſoning, when he makes him <hi>dery his knowing,</hi> what yet, according to the <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Syſtem, one of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37508:49"/>
                  <hi>knew?</hi> If this be not a Demonſtration, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> think there are no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences in the World, and it is impoſſible to diſcern what are manifeſt Arguments, what not. And therefore the Dr. they think, ſhould not barely have ſaid, as he doth, that there is ſomthing which <hi>ſeems very hard</hi> in his <hi>common Anſwer;</hi> but he ſhould have dared expreſly to affirm, that it is altogether very invalid and impertinent. Let the Reader himſelf judge of it, by conſidering the manner how our Saviour expreſſes himſelf in both the Evangeliſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of that Day and Hour, knows no Man,</hi> (or no Body, or no Perſon, for it is in the Original, <hi>None</hi> knows of that Day and of that Hour,) <hi>no not the Angels that are in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father.</hi> Mark, 13.32. And, at the 36th. Verſe of the 24th. of St. Math. <hi>but my Father only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(If the Reader pleaſe to ſee any more than what has here been ſaid upon theſe Texts, he may be refer'd to the 24th. Chapter of the <hi>Apologia pro Irenico Magno,</hi> and to the 9th. Chap. of the 2d. Section of <hi>Crell</hi>'s 1ſt. Book <hi>Touching one God the Father,</hi> in both which Places the Argument, taken from thoſe Paſſages of Scripture, is more at large treated of and moſt fully illuſtrated.)</p>
               <p>Here is then what Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> deſired, (Pag. 55th. of his aforequoted Book,) Namely, <hi>a Text, that proves Christ to be properly but a Creature, ſuch as the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans hold him to be.</hi> After this Argument, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> do not think any other to be very neceſſary. I ſhall therefore in a manner but mention the following, without much enlarging upon them.</p>
               <p>It need only be added, concerning the preſent Argument, that <hi>Crellius</hi> takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the other Anſwers to it, and that they moſt viſibly appear to be ſuch that they who inſiſt upon them do moſt evidently ſhew, that they are obſtinately reſolv'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend an old Prejudice, and that they will by no reaſonable Means be perſuaded to acknowledge the Truth, which diſpoſition cannot but be criminal.</p>
               <p>To ſay, for inſtance, that Chriſt, conſidered as God as well as Man, ſaid that he knew not the Day of Judgment, in the ſame ſenſe that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelf, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2.) that he determined not to know any thing among the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> ſave Chriſt Cruciſied; is it not to declare that thoſe Men will take hold of any Evaſion, rather than yield? For doth not that expreſſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>he determined not to know,</hi> ſhew manifeſtly <hi>the difference</hi> betwixt <hi>his</hi> Aſſertion and <hi>our Saviour</hi>'s, who ſays expreſly that <hi>he knew not</hi> the Day of Judgment, and that <hi>none but the Father knew it?</hi> The Expreſſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which we have rendered, <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,</hi> may be tranſlated, <hi>judged</hi> or <hi>condemned,</hi> and ſo <hi>Eraſmus</hi> has interpreted it, as if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid, (to declare that actually he did not rely on the force of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but on the Power it ſelf of the Goſpel, which he knew was attended with ſufficient Evidences, without ſetting it forth with the Ornaments and Advantages of an Elaborate Oration, as he might have done, which declaration is inconteſtably the ſcope and whole intent of the Apoſtle's reaſoning,) <q>I have condemned my ſelf to be among you,</q> or, <q>I have judged it fitteſt to be among you, as knowing nothing but Chriſt Crucified, leſt the Teſtimony of the Croſs and Sufferings of Chriſt and the Demonſtration of the Spirit ſhould be thought inſufficient Evidences, therefore when I came unto you, I came not with excellency of Speech, but barely contented my ſelf moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37508:50"/>to ſet before you the Teſtimony of God.</q> The current of the Diſcourſe ſhews, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not deny his knowing any thing beſides Chriſtianity, but only aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted that he judged a Demonſtration of all his other Learning unneceſſary, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of that, and in order to the end which he propoſed to himſelf, namely, the Converſion of the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> wherefore, according to our Verſion, he determined to be, or determined to appear, as knowing nothing elſe but Chriſt Crucified, and wholly neglected to make a ſhew of his Eloquence. It is undeniably evident, that this is his meaning. But it is as evident, that there is <hi>no ſuch reſtriction</hi> in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's expreſſion, and that he <hi>fimply</hi> denies his knowing at all the Day of Judgment, and <hi>expreſly</hi> aſſerts that none but the Father knew it. This Argument, it ſeems, therefore, will remain to the end of the World ſuch a one as the Dr. deſired, a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Proof, that Chriſt properly is not God Almighty himſelf: And the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> hold, that, to deny it, is to fly wilfully in the face of Evidence. For, as to the Knowledge of that Day, the Son puts himſelf into the ſame rank with the Angels and all other Creatures, and ſays that he knows it no more than they; which is as expreſs a denial of his knowing it, as it is poſſible to be.</p>
               <p>To this Head, and for a further Illuſtration of this Argument, we may add the Saying, in the firſt Verſe of the firſt Chapter of <hi>the Revelations,</hi> that <hi>God gave that Revelation to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For by thoſe words it appears, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had <hi>not</hi> that Revelation <hi>of himſelf,</hi> and conſequently that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is not <hi>the Supreme God,</hi> tho' yet he be God, or a God, and God's Repreſentative in whom the Father in an extraordinary manner dwells, as was ſaid.</p>
               <p>If that Perſon, deſigned or ſignified in Scripture by the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> were literally the Supreme God, that Verſe would bear this Senſe, that the Supreme God gave to another Perſon who is alſo the Supreme God a Revelation which he had not till then that it was given him; otherwiſe, if he had it before, it needed not to have been given him: On the other hand, if he had it not, 'tis plain this is an indigent God, not the ſame with the Giver, and conſequently not the Supreme God.</p>
               <p>To this ſome anſwer, that this Perſon received the whole Godhead from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity from the Father, and therefore whatever he enjoys at any time, or whatever knowledg he has, he may be ſaid to receive it from God, there, by God, meaning the Father. But we reply, this viſibly is precariouſly ſaid. For if from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Chriſt had all knowledg from the Father, what occaſion was there for taking notice here that he had this particular knowledg from God? There appears not to be here any particular reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>Therefore the laſt refuge is in the diſtinction of the two Natures. And ſo ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Meaning is, that the Father gave that Revelation to the Man Chriſt: (But then we reply, that was not neceſſary, if another All-knowing Perſon was hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically-united with that Man:) Or elſe it only remains the Meaning muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be, that the Second Perſon of the Trinity gave that Revelation to the Man Jeſus Chriſt. To this we reply. The Name Jeſus Chriſt denotes the whole Perſon; and, according to the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> that Perſon implies the Supreme God as well as the moſt highly dignified Creature; and therefore God then could not be ſaid ſimply, or in general terms, to give any thing to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:37508:50"/>III. The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> do very much wonder, that any one who has read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould ask for <hi>a</hi> Text, where it is taught that Chriſt is not literally the Almighty God himſelf; ſeeing that in <hi>Two Hundred and Seventy Three</hi> diſtinct Paſſages of the New Teſtament Chriſt is <hi>expreſly diſtinguiſhed from God.</hi> Whence rationally we ought to infer, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not literally and expreſly <hi>that God</hi> from whom he is <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed,</hi> and that therfore when <hi>he</hi> is called <hi>God</hi> it muſt be underſtood <hi>in an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Senſe,</hi> according to the Significations, we have mentioned, in which that Title is uſed: As in a Country (as it is in <hi>France</hi>) where <hi>the King's Eldeſt Son,</hi> when he is ſpoken of either ſingly or together with other Princes or Lords, is <hi>by way of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> called <hi>My Lord;</hi> it is obvious, that, then, <hi>another Lord</hi> (who is alſo, tho' <hi>in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior ſenſe,</hi> called <hi>My Lord,</hi> but <hi>not ſimply,</hi> or as by a diſtinguiſhing character, but as by a common title to which is and muſt be added ſomething to notify the Perſon ſpoken of, or who at leaſt is <hi>never ſimply</hi> ſtiled <hi>My Lord</hi> when ſpoken of <hi>together with the King's Eldeſt Son,</hi>) being <hi>thus diſtinguiſhed from My Lord,</hi> or from Him that is called <hi>My Lord</hi> ſimply and by way of eminency, then, I ſay, <hi>the other Lord</hi> is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declared <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>that My Lord</hi> himſelf, the King's Heir, but <hi>an inferior Lord.</hi> What the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> then here ſay, that the Title of <hi>God</hi> tho' moſt <hi>particularly</hi> and <hi>eminently appropriated</hi> to the <hi>Father,</hi> as it is in Scripture, does not <hi>exclude</hi> other Perſons, <hi>thus expreſly diſtinguiſhed</hi> from him, from being <hi>the ſame God,</hi> not only is a mere <hi>begging of the queſtion,</hi> and is <hi>without grounds,</hi> but is expreſly <hi>contrary to all reaſon.</hi> That Subterſuge therefore of the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> is wholly vain. And indeed did St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſuppoſe that <hi>Cornelius</hi> knew of the <hi>Evaſion</hi> of the <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> when, preaching the Goſpel to him, he <hi>diſtinguiſhed,</hi> in the current of his Diſcourſe, <hi>Chriſt</hi> from <hi>God? Acts,</hi> 10.36.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. At the 19th. Verſe of the 5th. of St. <hi>John,</hi> our Saviour himſelf tells us, that <hi>the Son can do nothing of himſelf, but what he ſees the Father do.</hi> Now, in good truth, could one, that were literally the Almighty God, ſay this concerning himſelf? Can the Almighty and All-Wiſe God be ſuppoſed able to do nothing, but what he muſt be taught how to do it? Surely it were a monſtrous Suppoſition, to reckon He need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be taught any thing. Whereas, if God's Only-Begotten Son be not properly <hi>God Almighty himſelf,</hi> but <hi>the Word Incarnate,</hi> (according to the <hi>Arians,</hi>) ſuch as we have deſcribed, who from the beginning was a God in the higheſt ſignification of the inſerior ſenſes in which that title is uſed in Scripture, and who is aſſiſted of God in the manner we have declared, it is very rational and true to ſay of him, that he cannot do the Divine Works of himſelf, but that he doth them only as he is taught and aſſiſted by the Father to do them. To which agrees, what he ſays, at the 10th. Verſe of the 14th. Chapter of the ſame Goſpel; <hi>the Father,</hi> (not a Second Divine Perſon,) <hi>that dwels in me, he</hi> properly <hi>doth the Works,</hi> inaſmuch as it is he that aſſiſts me to do them: And, accordingly, Chriſt declared, that, tho' he had a vaſt Power even then granted him and was enabled to do mighty Miracles, yet God (the free Donor and Diſpoſer thereof) had reſerv'd infinitely more Prerogative to himſelf, and the Diſciples were not to doubt but that <hi>God,</hi> from whom Chriſt had all that he had, was ſtill <hi>greater than he.</hi> John, 14, 28.</p>
               <p n="5">V. In like manner, a Perſon, that were literally the Almighty God himſelf, could not ſay to the Father, (as Chriſt doth, <hi>John,</hi> 17.5.) <hi>Glorify thou me with thine own ſelf,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37508:51"/>with the Glory which I had with thee before the World was.</hi> For, whatever the <hi>Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> may ſay or think of it, a Perſon that were literally the Almighty God, could no more be at any time without his Glory, than he could ever be without his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Eſſence, or could ceaſe to exiſt. For the Higheſt Glory is inſeparable from the Supreme God; for as he exiſts neceſſarily from all Eternity, ſo he is neceſſarily All-Perfect, and conſequently All-Glorious. But <hi>the Word,</hi> being ſuch as we have deſcribed, having received all his Perfection from the mere free Bounty of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and holding the Height of his Glory precariouſly from the Hand of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God, and as but during the Pleaſure of the Almighty; this Sublime Creature then, I ſay, that is called <hi>the Word,</hi> might be diveſted of the greateſt part of his Glory for a time, and be reduced to and contracted into the Narrowneſs and Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of an Innocent Human Soul, for the Undertaking and Performance of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Office, during which, conſidering the Anguiſh and Difficulties attending it, this Perſon may well be ſuppoſed to groan and long for that excellent and ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Glory and Happineſs, which he enjoyed with God before the World was, being then glorified and dignified with an extraordinary and an eminent and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate partaking even of the Divine Nature, Soveraignty and Power, which, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Man, he in a great meaſure actually depoſited into the hands of God, (to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive again, indeed, afterward, with Intereſt,) whereas, as was ſaid, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Almighty God at all to depoſite at any time his Perfection, Power and Glory. See the afore-quoted Treatiſe of <hi>Crellius,</hi> Book 1ſt. Section 2d. Chapter 18th. on the Argument, <hi>That all things are given to Chriſt from the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. The laſt Argument of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> which I ſhall now take notice of, and that alſo briefly, (conſidering all that has been ſaid here and elſewhere,) is, That it is expreſly declared, in ſeveral Places of Scripture, that <hi>the Father Only</hi> is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John,</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is Life eternal, to know thee only,</hi> (Father,) <hi>to be the true God, and Jeſus Chriſt to be thy Meſſenger.</hi> It is evident that that muſt neceſſarily be the Conſtruction of the words For the Adjective <hi>Only,</hi> when it is employed to exclude other Subjects from the partaking of the Predicate, belongs to the Subject, and not to the Predicate. Now it is inconteſtable; (ſeeing the Reaſon of the Thing, and the Scope of the Argument; that is, the Reſolution of theſe grand Articles, Namely, Who is the true God; And, Which is the Way to eternal Life?) and indeed it is agreed by all; that in this place the word, <hi>Only,</hi> is employed to exclude other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from the partaking of the Predicate. Wherefore all others, beſides the Father, are hereby neceſſarily excluded from being the true God. For if all others were not ſo, then none could be ſuppos'd to be hereby excluded; and ſo the reaſoning would be inſignificant. See <hi>Crell,</hi> in the beginning of his afore-quoted Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.4, 5, 6. <hi>There is one Spirit, one Hope, one Lord, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all, who is above all.</hi> The Father only is that God who is above all, or who is properly the True and Supreme God.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one God, and one Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> That it is the Father only who is that <hi>one God,</hi> is then evident; in that Chriſt is oppoſed to that <hi>one God:</hi> And the Mediator between God and Men, is ſaid to be a <hi>Man,</hi> and not a God-Man. See <hi>Crell,</hi> on that Text.</p>

                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:37508:51"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. <hi>To us there is but one God, the Father.</hi> (To which Place we may joyn the 9th. Verſe of the 3d. of St. <hi>James</hi>'s.) That one, then, who is properly the God, is the Father, of whom are all things. And, under him, there is but one Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Lord, by and for whom the Father prepared all things, that this moſt God-like Lord might be at the Head of them, to the greateſt Glory of the Father, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and Supreme, the only Wiſe, (perfectly, and in himſelf,) and the only one, the true God. See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. compared with <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.6. and 16.27.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.17. <hi>

               <p>Thus we ſee the <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Syſtem.</hi> Upon which account, they think, they are the more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized, and inconteſtably warranted, to conſult alſo as they do in this Matter the Light of Reaſon, which, as was ſaid, furniſhes them with ſeveral unanſwerable Arguments of the Impoſſibility of the Scholaſtick or Platonick <hi>Trinity of real Divine Perſons</hi> in one God (as may be ſeen in the <hi>Apologia pro Irenico Magno,</hi>) and, conſequently, of the Reaſonableneſs of the <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Interpretations.

               <p>Here then it is very fit to remember Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Words, which we quoted before, and which are to this purpoſe: <q>That if any Text be produced, which proves Chriſt <hi>(properly or in his own Perſon)</hi> to be but a Creature, this ought to put an end to the Controverſy, and either excuſe or juſtify all the <hi>

               <head>CHAP. XV. <hi>The Inferences most inconteſtably following from the whole foregoing Diſcourſe, and the Goſpel-Terms of Communion.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FROM the whole, theſe four things do moſt inconteſtably follow, as the leaſt that can be granted to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> by Proteſtants that impartially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Arguments treated of in the foregoing Diſcourſe, and in the <hi>Apologia pro Irenico Magno.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. That the State of this Controverſy is ſuch, that <hi>Men may be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians, and be very ſincere, pious and inquiſitive;</hi> and that if <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm</hi> be an Error, it is not a damnable and an intolerable one, or an Hereſy.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That, in the Caſe of this moſt abſtruſe Controverſy, we ought, in our Terms of Communion, with relation thereunto, to keep to the Generality of the Terms of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not Magiſterially determine this Matter any farther than that Generality, nor force or fright away the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> out of the Church-Society, but ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate our Publick Service, and our Terms of Church-Union, according to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Generality of the Expreſſions of Scripture, ſo as that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> may without Scruple joyn with Us therein; ſeeing <hi>the Goſpel-Terms of Communion,</hi> and <hi>the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Proteſtants,</hi> require this Moderation, and enjoyn that Method, <hi>in reference to ſuch Points, as are ſo very difficult and intricate,</hi> that ſincere and inquiſitive Perſons may be at a loſs and may miſtake about them.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That, therefore, <hi>First,</hi> in the Publick Service we ought to addreſs the Current of our Prayers directly as well as ultimately to God in general, in the Name &amp; thro' the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Chriſt, in the Concluſion of them beſeeching God to hear us, &amp; grant us our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, <hi>for the Sake of</hi> his Dear Son, our Bleſſed Lord, Saviour and Redeemer; and ſo when we addreſs ſome Ejaculations to Chriſt, we ought, as has been ſhewn, in general to addreſs to him as to our Mediator or Mediatory Governor, &amp; Soveraign, in whom the Fulneſs of the God-head ſo dwells, as abundantly and conſtantly to aſſiſt him in the Diſcharge of his Mediatory Office, whereby he both acts for God and repreſents God, &amp; is in ſome ſenſe God: <hi>Secondly,</hi> in our Publick Service likewiſe, &amp; the Terms of Church-Union, we ought to be content with the Apoſtles Creed, which is word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Generality agreable to that of Scripture, and ought not to think other Creeds neceſſary or expedient, which are artificially fram'd on purpoſe to depart from that Generality, and are incumbred with Human Deciſions and Magiſterial Impoſitions: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> no Subſcription or Aſſent ought to be required of Clergy-men, but to the Bible it ſelf, &amp; to Doctrines expreſſed in the Words of Scripture, or in Terms that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the Scripture-Generality, the Clergy-men's Declaration being admitted, that they Subſcribe and Aſſent to the things propoſed to them, but ſo far as they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the Generality of Scripture. Theſe <hi>Three</hi> Points not only follow neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily from the 2d. Inference, but are implied in it; and we rank them on a diſtinct Head, only that the Principles in general which are the Grounds on which theſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37508:52"/>are built, may firſt be more diſtinctly obſerved to be neceſſarily deducible from <hi>the Firſt Inference</hi> and from <hi>the Goſpel-Terms of Communion,</hi> and that then it may diſtinctly be conſidered what Particulars neceſſarily follow from thoſe Principles, that the ſaid Particulars may upon thoſe demonſtrated Grounds be firmly eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That, among all the other inconteſtable Reaſons, for this Generality in the Terms of Church-Union, this is one, which follows from the Firſt and Second Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, &amp; deſerves a diſtinct rank, Namely: that <hi>this Method is the ſafeſt,</hi> in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy at leaſt to be own'd by all conſidering <hi>Trinitarians</hi> to be moſt intricate: <hi>and</hi> that inconteſtably <hi>it ſuffices</hi> to Pray to God in general, to ſatisfy to the Duty of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the God-head; God in general including the whole God-head; ſo that, when God in general is directly &amp; ultimately Pray'd to, all is certainly worſhipped that is to be adored with Supreme Worſhip: and when our Petitions are put up in the Name of Chriſt, the Mediatory Honour due to our Saviour is thereby paid him, being thus addreſſed to as the Mediator of the New Covenant, in whom the Fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwells, as was ſaid.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>That the State of this Controverſy is ſuch, that Men may be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians, and be very ſincere, pious and inquiſitive; and that if <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm be an Error, it is not a damnable and an intolerable one, or a Hereſy.</hi> This follows from the <hi>high Probability</hi> (at leaſt) of <hi>the Arguments for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm,</hi> to ſay no more of them; for, after all, upon mature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, <hi>theſe Arguments</hi> ſeem to be <hi>expreſs,</hi> and <hi>unanſwerable;</hi> and on the other hand it ſeems, that a <hi>Solution</hi> is given to <hi>the Chiefest Objections of the Scholaſtick or Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonick Trinitarians.</hi> Howbeit, <hi>this</hi> at leaſt cannot be denied to be <hi>a moſt difficult &amp; intricate Point.</hi> And admitting, that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Syſtem has no higher evidence than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is encumbred with as great Difficulties, (to which Sentiment I have often, for a great while, been moſt inclined, even ſince I began to write on this Subject, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming it to be God's will and intention that we ſhould for the moſt part ſuſpend our judgment about it, and indeed it may with great appearance of reaſon be judged the fitteſt not to be too deciſive in ſo myſterious and abſtruſe a Matter;) yet no advantage can thence be taken againſt the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> and every <hi>Trinitarian,</hi> that carefully and ſincerely conſiders the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Arguments, ſeeing they are ſo weighty and conſiderable, muſt at leaſt grant that they are ſuch, that Men may take them to be good Arguments, and yet be very Honeſt, hearty Lovers of God, and to the beſt of their power Inquiſitive, and that, conſequently, if <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm</hi> be an Error, it is not a damnable and an intolerable one, or a Hereſy. For is it credible, that God will aſſign the dreadful Torments of Hell; for an Error, which good Men, who ſincerely and diligently ſeek to know his Will and to practice it, cannot avoid taking for a Truth? God puniſhes nothing but what has ſome Wickedneſs in it, or ſome Pravity and Malice. Now what Malice or Wickedneſs is there, in being ſincere, and ſeeking moſt carefully to underſtand the real Meaning of the Scripture? No Men do account innocent <hi>Miſtakes</hi> puniſhable, <hi>in moſt difficult Matters,</hi> in which honeſt and diligent Perſons may err. And ſhall we think God harder than Men? Far be that thought from any Chriſtian! The Goſpel is a benign and a gracious Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, and we are in the hands of the Father of Mercies. We may then be ſure, that God will not impute unavoidable (and therefore pitiable) Errors. Wherefore the moſt rigid <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> that will impartially and attentively conſider
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:37508:53"/>the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Arguments, muſt needs diſcern, that, if <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm</hi> be an Error, yet it is not a damnable one, and conſequently not an intolerable one, nor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Hereſy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 20. The Apoſtle declares that <hi>Hereſy,</hi> taken in an evil Senſe, (for in general it ſignifies <hi>a Sect,</hi> which includes ſome particular Sentiment, whether good or bad,) is <hi>a Work of the Fleſh,</hi> that is, is the Attendant and Product of Wilfulneſs and Wickedneſs. And therefore, from what has been ſaid, it manifeſtly appears, that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm</hi> cannot be a <hi>Hereſy,</hi> in that Senſe, tho' it were an Error; ſeeing that, if it be ſuppoſed that it may be an Error, yet it cannot but be own'd it has ſo many Arguments of Credibility, and looks ſo much like a Truth, that inquiſitive Men may very honeſtly miſtake about it, if indeed they err when they take it for the very Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and real Senſe of Scripture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.11. The ſame Apoſtle expreſly ſays, that thoſe that are Hereticks, in being ſo, ſin willfully, and are condemned of their own Conſcience, being perverted by ſome evil conſideration, knowing that they do not ſincerely what lies in them towards the acknowledgement of the Truth, and it being in their power to conſider and diſcern that their Tenets are not right, but favour Vice, and are ſuggeſted by the Fleſh. So that a Hereſy is a criminal and wilful departing from ſome Evident Truth, for the gratifying of Senſual Inclinations. Such was the Hereſy of the <hi>Nicolaïtans,</hi> who (as it is thought) would have Women to be Common. Such was the Hereſy of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> who made Religion to conſiſt in Speculation and the Knowledge of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, and who held that it was lawful to diſſemble the truth to avoid Perſecution. And ſuch is the Hereſy of thoſe, who, poſſeſſed with a domineering Spirit, and a haſty and imperious Temper, drive away from their Communion, by Human Deciſions, thoſe that differ from their Sentiment, in Matters that are moſt Difficult. This is a Schiſmatical Hereſy.</p>
               <p>But there is no ſuch thing in <hi>the Sentiment of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> if it be an Error. It is far from gratifying the Fleſh. It doth not indulge a careleſs and lazy humour, averſe to conſideration, and making Men willing to follow others blindly any whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo they may but enjoy their eaſe and pleaſure. But it expoſes Men to trouble. And it is grounded on Arguments, that manifeſtly appear rational, and apt to perſuade thoſe, who are ſincere and inquiſitive, and who fear and love God. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm</hi> doth not require of any Chriſtians, nor doth impoſe upon them, any thing againſt their Conſcience, or neceſſitate them to diſſemble their Sentiments. For it is not Magiſterial, and Impoſing; <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> in Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s words, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Bible, that is, the Generality of the Expreſſions of Scripture, for Terms of Church Communion. And that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm</hi> doth not cauſe Men to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely wanting in any eſſential Part of Religion, is implied in this conſideration, that it is attended with ſo much Evidence and Credibility, that Men, as has been ſhewn, may be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> and be guiltleſs and without crime; it being not to be thought, that God has made any thing abſolutely eſſential to Religion, wherein ſincere and inquiſitive Perſons may miſtake. For when Men, out of a Principle of Piety, do, in all Particulars, and even in the moſt intricate, what they can, to be rightly Inform'd, and to diſcharge their Duty; what can a Good God exact more?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:37508:53"/>According to the Natural Ideas of God, the Tenor of the Goſpel, and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Proteſtants; <hi>Whatſoever is indiſpenſibly Neceſſary muſt needs be Ciear and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernible to all that are ſincerely Inquiſitive.</hi> And, after all, it cannot be denied, but that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> acknowledge thoſe weighty Points, which are abſolutely requiſite, to move us to love and obey <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ.</hi> For in general they believe, that Chriſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's expreſs Will is to be lov'd and worſhipped on God's account and to God's Glory and as moſt intimately united with God, that the Spirit belonging to Chriſt (which Chriſt diſpoſes of, which He communicates to his Diſciples, and whereby Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are ſanctified) is the Spirit and Power of God, that God dwells and acts moſt eminently in Chriſt, and that Chriſt is in the higheſt Station of the Univerſe, all Things being Subjected to him, the Father only excepted, to whoſe Praiſe and Service all Diſpenſations are deſigned ultimately to tend, (as all own,) and who efficaciouſly directs and aſſiſts Chriſt in his Soveraign and Univerſal Government, whereby Chriſt rules and acts as God, and according to his Deſire, and the Laws he has enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſtabliſhed by the Covenant of Grace, thus appearing not as being a Subject, but as being the Soveraign, together with the Father, in this illuſtrious Oeconomy, the Effect and Fruit of which will laſt for ever, and the Honour and Glory where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will eternally crown the Lord Jeſus, ſo that he ſhall to all Eternity be moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately United to the Father, and, when he ſhall particularly commit and deliver up the Univerſal Adminiſtration of Government into God's hands, when all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhall have attain'd to a Sinleſs Perfection and ſhall become Subjects to the Laws of a moſt Perfect State, even then he ſhall retain <hi>the title of Soveraign,</hi> he ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be <hi>the next to God,</hi> and, tho' himſelf Subject to God ſo as that he ſhall live under God's peculiar Government and that <hi>all Creatures under him</hi> ſhall be under ſuch an Oeconomy with reſpect to the Father as <hi>Adam</hi> was and as therefore may in that reſpect be termed <hi>the Law</hi> and not <hi>the Goſpel,</hi> he ſhall remain World without end the Prince and Head of all Men and Angels. The <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> therefore believe Chriſt to be moſt highly exalted and dignified, and to be moſt intimately partaker of the Divine Nature, infinitely more eminently than <hi>Joſeph</hi> was made partaker of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Majeſty and Government together with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when <hi>Pharaoh</hi> told him, <hi>See I have ſet thee over all the Land of Egypt; thou ſhalt be over my Houſe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto thy Word ſhall all my People be ruled; only in the Throne will I be greater than thou;</hi> and when, accordingly, <hi>Pharaoh took off his Ring from his Hand, and put it upon Joſeph's Hand, and arrayed him in Princely Apparel, and made him to ride in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chariot which he had, and they cried before him, Bow the Knee; and ſo Pharaoh made Joſeph Ruler over all the Land of Egypt, and he ſwore to him that he ſhould be the Diſpoſer of War and Peace, and that all things ſhould be managed, according to his Deſire, and by his Laws and his Orders.</hi> Geneſ. 41.40. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This firſt Inference then is inconteſtable; <hi>That Men may be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians, and be very pious and ſincerely inquiſitive.</hi> If any body will deny it, let him ſhew that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Arguments are frivolous, contemptible and inſignificant. Till then, We ſhall be obliged to hold, <hi>that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians are accopted of God.</hi> This is <hi>one</hi> of thoſe <hi>four</hi> things, which ſeem to be the leaſt that can be granted, and <hi>concluded,</hi> from <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Arguments.</hi> The <hi>Second Inference,</hi> which, with the <hi>two other,</hi> is of the like nature with <hi>this,</hi> is now to be conſidered, and is <hi>to this effect.</hi>

               <p>If the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Sentiment has ſo very conſiderable and weighty Arguments, that pious and inquiſitive Men may, ſincerely and without any crime on their part, take it to be the true Meaning of Scripture; We cannot <hi>Magiſterially determine</hi> that Controverſy to the Scholaſtick and <hi>Anti-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Senſe, by any Human and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> without <hi>rejecting out of our Communion thoſe whom God receives.</hi> In doing which, we manifeſtly tranſgreſs <hi>the expreſs Injunction</hi> of the Apoſtle's, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14, 1, not to reject thoſe who may be accounted to be weak in the Faith, in ſuch a caſe, that, notwithſtanding their ſuppos'd weakneſs and error, it appears they may ſtill be acceptable to God. Indeed the Apoſtle wills not, that ſuch be admitted expreſly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the Church about doubtful Matters; howbeit, 'tis evident on the other hand, what he enjoyns can imply no leſs than this, that the Terms of Church-Communion be regulated in that Generality, that no Publick Determinations and Impoſitions be made, as would drive away thoſe who may be accounted to be weak in the Faith in ſuch a caſe as this. Otherwiſe, how can We be ſaid <hi>to receive them?</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle therefore thus argues, at the 4th. Verſe of this Chapter; <hi>Who art thou that judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt another Man's Servant? To his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth, yea, he ſhall be holden up.</hi> And at the 13th. Verſe he concludes the Argument in theſe words; <hi>Let us not then judge one another any more; but judge this rather, that no Man put a ſtumbling-block, or an occaſion to fall in his brother's way.</hi> (See Biſhop <hi>Wilkin's</hi> two Sermons on <hi>Rom.</hi> 17.17, 18.)</p>
               <p>Theſe are manifeſtly and inconteſtably <hi>the Goſpel-Terms of Church-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> and this is all that I plead for, and no Proteſtant can with any colour of reaſon refuſe theſe Terms, conſiſtently to the Principles of the Reformation.</p>
               <p>(According to theſe Principles, what Right had <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> or the <hi>Nicene,</hi> to make and impoſe New Creeds; to judge Magiſterially for all the Members of the Church; to determine Magiſterially the Generality of Scripture; to ſtraiten the Terms of Communion, in Matters at leaſt moſt abſtruſe and intricate; and thus to break the Church's Union in pieces?)</p>
               <p>We hold, that the Scripture is a perfect and ſufficient Rule; that there is no living, publick, magiſterial Judge of Controverſies; that the Church-Governors are not to exerciſe dominion over the Faith of their People; that they are not infallible; that every one is bound to examine, and is to be allowed the Judgment of diſcerning. (See Biſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi>'s aforequoted Sermons.) Now what follows from theſe and the like Principles, but that, in moſt abſtruſe and intricate Matters, We muſt not make publick Determinations and Impoſitions, but muſt then ſtrictly keep to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Terms of Scripture, as is ſhewn in the Firſt and Second Chapters of the <hi>Apologia pro Irenico Magno?</hi> Otherwiſe, it is moſt palpably evident, We expreſly contradict our own Principles; We allow not to the Church-Members the liberty to judge for themſelves; We reckon not the Expreſſions and Generality of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:37508:54"/>to be a ſufficient Rule of Union, but imagin We can deviſe one better and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; We act, as if We were infallible, and were the Magiſterial Judges of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, and, not contenting our ſelves with the Terms of Scripture for Terms of Union, nor being content to ſet the Truth on its own Bottom, We run the hazard, ſince We may err, of fighting effectually and criminally againſt God, in cruſhing the Truth, in eternizing Error, in taking away the Key of Knowledge, and at leaſt in oppreſſing the Conſciences of thoſe whom God accepts, and in being the Cauſe of endleſs Schiſms and Diviſions.</p>
               <p>It follows then, (according to the 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16, 17. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.1. and 13. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to the 6th. Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and to all the aboveſaid Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Proteſtants.</hi>) That, <hi>in our Terms of Church-Communion, with relation to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarian Controverſy, We ought to keep exactly to the Generality of the Expreſſions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not to make, beyond it, any Publick Determinations and Impoſitions, which would drive away the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians out of our Communion.</hi> Hence therefore We muſt neceſſarily infer.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>That, First, in the Publick Service, We ought to addreſs the Current of our Prayers directly as well as ultimately to God in general, in the Name and thro' the Mediation of Chriſt, in the concluſion of them beſecching God to hear us, and grant us our Requeſts, for the Sake of his Dear Son, our Bleſſed Lord, Saviour and Redeemer, and ſo, when We addreſs ſome Ejaculations to Chriſt, We ought in general to addreſs to him as to our Mediator, or Mediatory Governor, &amp; Soveraign, in whom the Fulneſs of the Godhead ſo dwells, as abundantly &amp; conſtantly to aſſiſt him in the Diſcharge of his Mediatory Office, whereby he both acts for God and repreſents God, and is in ſome ſenſe God: Secondly, in our Publick Service likewiſe, and the Terms of Church-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, We ought to be content with the Apoſtles Creed, which is worded in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality agreable to that of Scripture: Thirdly, no Subſcription or Aſſent ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Clergy-men, in this Matter and its Dependents, but to the Expreſſions of the Scripture it ſelf, or to Terms that agree to the Scripture-Generality.</hi> For if We do not take theſe Meaſures or do not follow this Method, if we do not ſtick to this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in all Terms and Acts of Church-Union, and <hi>do not content</hi> our ſelves, with a general Profeſſion that Chriſt is God, and with the Scriptural-Terms and Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; we both act raſhly and unjuſtly, in a moſt intricate Matter, and <hi>We drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> out of our Communion, <hi>not receiving</hi> them without they think in theſe difficult Points exactly as we do, and ſubmit to our Deciſions, and profeſs the eternal Generation, three Perſons in one God-head, and the Equality of the Son and Spirit with the Father; which is to judge for others in a moſt abſtruſe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Subject, and to require of them, as Terms of Union, to act againſt their Conſcience, as the generality of them believe, and be hypocrites, and utter lies, and groſly equivocate, in the greateſt Solemnities of Religion; whereby many Souls may be cauſed to periſh, for whom Chriſt died. (See <hi>The Conſequences of the Moda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts Syſtem.</hi>) The <hi>Athanaſian</hi> and <hi>Nicene</hi> Creeds are too expreſs, or particular, and magiſterial, for ſo ſubling Speculations, left in ſo great a Generality as we ſee theſe are in Scripture. We have no right, therefore, to ſet up <hi>ſuch magiſterial</hi> &amp; <hi>imperious</hi> Terms of Communion, (according to the Proteſtant Principles,) as it appears from what has been ſaid; but We are neceſſarily oblig'd to keep to <hi>the Terms of Church-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> that we have <hi>here</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:37508:55"/>deſcribed; ſeeing it appears, that We are to <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> and <hi>not to drive them away out of our Communion,</hi> it being inconteſtable, upon impartial conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Controverſy is of that nature, that Men may be <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> and be very ſincere and inquiſitive, and conſequently not to be rejected, and it being to be remarked that the Generality of the Scripture-Terms is ſufficient and ſafe; from the whole it being neceſſarily to be inferred in the laſt place.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>That this Generality, in Terms of Church-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, is a ſafe Method, in ſo intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate a Matter, and is inconteſtably ſufficient; all being certainly worſhipped, when God in general is directly and ultimately Prayed to, that is to be adored with Supreme Worſhip, and the Mediatory Honour due to our Saviour being paid him, when our Petitions are put up in the Name of Chriſt, as our Interceſſor and Redeemer, moſt beloved of God, and exalted at God's Right Hand, and ſo is addreſſed to as the Mediator of the New Covenant as was ſaid.</hi> In moſt intricate Matters, that certainly cannot but be <hi>moſt ſafe,</hi> which is ſubject to the leaſt Inconveniencies, and which is in ſome meaſure <hi>ſufficient.</hi> And inconteſtably it is <hi>ſufficient</hi> to worſhip <hi>God</hi> with <hi>Supreme</hi> Worſhip; for <hi>all that is God</hi> is Worſhipped, when <hi>God in general</hi> is Worſhipped. Wherefore the generality of the Reformed Churches content themſelves to addreſs their Prayers <hi>in general</hi> to God. And ſome of the moſt Learned <hi>Trinitarians</hi> maintain, that it is not lawful to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but that formal Addreſſes to different Moſt Supreme Perſons, in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſet up different Objects of Supreme Worſhip.</p>
               <p>For the ſame reaſons, in the Publick <hi>Terms of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> a <hi>general Profeſſion</hi> of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> in the <hi>general Expreſſions of Scripture,</hi> is both <hi>the ſafeſt,</hi> and is certainly <hi>ſufficient.</hi> And all this doth even neceſſarily follow from the 1ſt. and 2d. Inferences. For there it appears, that <hi>God abſolutely requires no more, for Terms of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> What God therefore is content with to that end, is to that end inconteſtably <hi>ſafeſt</hi> as well as <hi>ſufficient:</hi> ſo that if Men, inſtead of taking upon them to be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterial Judges, would have ſtuck to the Latitude and Generality of Scripture, for Terms of Agreement and Union, all had been well.</p>
               <p>We muſt needs then own, that <hi>the Scripture-Expreſſions,</hi> to be adhered to in <hi>Terms of Church-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> at leaſt will <hi>ſuffice</hi> to all the indiſpenſibly neceſſary ends of <hi>Salvation;</hi> and that, conſequently, it is ſufficient in general to know and believe, that the Holy Ghoſt is the Spirit and Inſpiration and Power of God, and that Chriſt is the Only-Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God, in whom the Fulneſs of the God-head (that may be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and that is an Influence of all the Divine Perfections) moſt intimately dwells, and that he is in ſome ſenſe God. It is evident, that this Syſtem furniſhes the ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to love God and Chriſt, and to practiſe the Precepts of the Goſpel, that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Syſtem doth. For if one Divine Perſon with the Influences and Aſſiſtances of his Wiſdom and Power be ſuppos'd to do, together with Chriſt, all that belongs to our Salvation; have we the leſs reaſon to be thankful to God and Chriſt, and to hearken to the Goſpel-Injunctions, than if we ſuppos'd three Divine Perſons, or called God three Perſons? It is as effectual therefore to the ends of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to hold, that the Spirit is the Power of God, and that Chriſt moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently acts for God, and is moſt intimately united with God, by the means of the Divine Influence dwelling in him, ſo that when Chriſt is obey'd and lov'd, thereby God is actually lov'd and obey'd, Chriſt being thus lookt upon, both,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37508:55"/>as moſt excellently and moſt extraordinarily repreſenting God, and as being in ſome ſenſe God. Many <hi>Trinitarians</hi> do expreſly aſſert, that the Second Perſon is but a continual <hi>Acting</hi> of the Father. Why may not the ſame be ſaid of the Holy Spirit and Inſpiration? Or why may not <hi>the Word</hi> and <hi>the Spirit</hi> be ſtiled <hi>Influences,</hi> as well as <hi>Acts,</hi> of the Father? Howbeit, We may certainly very fitly conclude this Subject, with the Words of the late Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> at the 7th. Page of that Book of his, intituled, <hi>The Preſent State of the Socinian Controverſy,</hi> where, concerning the (human, and unſcriptural) Expreſſions, <hi>three Perſons, Of the ſame Subſtance, Eſſence,</hi> and the like, he has this judicious remark; <hi>The Catholick Faith does not depend upon the uſe of theſe terms, for it was before them.</hi> Now, this is all that I plead for; <hi>that theſe and the like unſcriptural terms be not lookt upon as neceſſary for Chriſtian-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> but <hi>that Chriſtians may be ſo reaſonable and juſt as to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite in the Generality of the Expreſſions of Scripture,</hi> which, it is evident, God has judg'd <hi>ſufficient,</hi> ſince He thought fit to uſe them, as He has done, that is, in <hi>the Generality</hi> of which they appear ſuſceptible. Inconteſtably, then, 'tis neither <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> nor indeed, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, <hi>Safe,</hi> nor <hi>Just,</hi> in ſuch <hi>moſt Intricate Matters,</hi> to go beyond <hi>the very expreſs Words of Scripture,</hi> in <hi>Terms and Acts of Church-Communion.</hi> (Beſides; Are not the <hi>Tares</hi> as well as <hi>Wheat</hi> to be ſuffered in the Church, by Chriſt's Order? <hi>Math.</hi> 13.30.) The <hi>Scripture-Latitude</hi> muſt needs therefore be THE TERMS OF UNION. We need not and ought not to be more expreſs, or determining, and impoſing, than the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' the Perſon of Chriſt were not fully known, yet, notwithſtanding that there is no other Name by which Penitent Men are Saved, He may be the Saviour of all them in every Nation who do righteouſneſs, and for his Sake God may accept of their ſincere Repentance and Obedience. As <hi>Amyraldus</hi> judiciouſly obſerved; if a Prince has been graciouſly pleaſed to ranſom a Captive, or pay the Debts of a Poor Priſoner, <hi>that Redeemed one</hi> is not the leſs ranſomed and made free, tho' he do not perfectly or exactly know all that belongs to the Perſon by whom he is redeemed; all that is reaſonably and indiſpenſably requiſite being that he ſhould do what he can to know his Benefactor, and that he ſhould be in a hearty diſpoſition to expreſs his Gratitude for the Benefit, to the beſt of his power, according to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he can get thereof.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Revelations,</hi> 19, 12, We find it is ſaid, that our Saviour has a Name, which no Man underſtands but He Himſelf. Why then ſhould We be ſo Deciſive, Magiſterial and Impoſing, as if We certainly and infallibly underſtood all theſe <hi>Myſteries?</hi> As we cannot reaſonably imagin that we infallibly underſtand the moſt difficult things, we ought not in reaſon to pretend to determine and judge for other Men in the moſt abſtruſe and intricate Matters. Howbeit, it ſeems the <hi>Semi-Arian</hi> Syſtem is much the ſame with, or not eſſentially different from, this, of the Father, or God, and his two Powers, and Influences or Acts. And it ſeems, <hi>this</hi> is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable with <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon.</hi> God grant Us all to do our Duty, in this Inquiry, and in all reſpects, that We may diſcern and follow the things abſolutely Neceſſary to Peace and Salvation!</p>

And, then, as was obſerved, <hi>the Scholaſtick Trinitarians</hi> acknowledge, that <hi>the Father implies the whole God head.</hi> Our Saviour is expreſs, that the Father dwells in him, and doth the Works in him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.10. And the Apoſtle teaches us, that Chriſt is to be honoured to the Glory of the Father. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11.</p>
            <p>All therefore that is meant, and that appears can be meant, by the Divinity of Chriſt, or the Hypoſtatick Union, is, that the Divine Nature is ſo intimately unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Soul of the Man Jeſus Chriſt, (as the Human Soul is with the Body,) that the Divine Influence, or Divine Indwelling, in him, and particularly the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom, conſtantly illuminate, conduct and aſſiſt Chriſt, ſo as to enable him, to repreſent God at the Head of the Univerſe &amp; to perform all the things neceſſary for ſuch a Repreſentative of God to do; ſo that what belongs to God may be ſaid to be Chriſt's, (all in kind, tho' not all in all degrees,) who ſees &amp; honours Chriſt may be ſaid to ſee &amp; honour God, &amp; what God doth at Chriſt's deſire may be ſaid to be done by Chriſt, who procures it to be done by the God-head dwelling in him, as a Human Soul, ſimply and meerly by deſiring, procures of the Body, with which ſhe is united, to do many Actions, that ſhe willeth, &amp; that God has ſubjected to the Soul's Will and Power. Hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that ſome Texts of Scripture in ſome ſenſe import the Supreme Divinity of Chriſt, yet it can never be prov'd, or with any colour of reaſon pretended, that they neceſſarily imply any more than this. For there are invincible Arguments againſt the being of more than one real Perſon in God; &amp; by a Figure, common in Scripture &amp; in all Languages, Perſonal Acts may reaſonably be attributed to Divine <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> or to a Divine <hi>Influence,</hi> tho' it be not a diſtinct Perſon, but a <hi>Property</hi> or an <hi>Act</hi> of the Father. (Even <hi>Charity</hi> is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a <hi>Perſon,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1. And God is ſaid to ſend forth his <hi>Mercy, Pſ.</hi> 57.3.) Suppoſing then that by <hi>the Word,</hi> in the beginning of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, be meant the Divine Wiſdom, produc'd forth and ſhewn in the Old and New Creation, (as it is even interpreted in <hi>the Brief Hiſtory;</hi>) in that caſe, it muſt neceſſarily be ſuppos'd to be ſaid by a <hi>Figure</hi> to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate,</hi> meaning that it <hi>reſted upon,</hi> in an extraordinary &amp; moſt ample manner, or <hi>most intimately dwelt with,</hi> and <hi>conſtantly aſſiſted and illuminated,</hi> the Man Jeſus Chriſt, as if it had become Part of him, or were his own Soul. Chriſt, then, the Son of God, is a Divine Perſon, in that he is a Man aſſiſted and inhabited by a Divine Influence, or Divine Virtue.</p>
            <p>And holding that ſome Texts of Scripture aſſert the Supreme Divinity of the Holy Ghoſt, it doth not follow that thereby is meant any thing elſe than the Divine <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> or an Influence of the Divine <hi>Power,</hi> (either Directing or Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Working,) that is commonly annexed to, and, ſo, communicated to Men by, the Chief Arch-angel, and (under him) ſome Select Angels, or the whole Body of Holy Angels, as a healing Virtue was ſometimes annexed to, and communicated by, the Waters of <hi>Jordan,</hi> &amp;c. (2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 5, 14, 13, 21. <hi>John,</hi> 9.6. <hi>Acts,</hi> 19.12.)</p>
            <p>Now, then, tho' the <hi>Divine Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> be <hi>God</hi> himſelf, that doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Syſtem, or neceſſarily imply more than one real Perſon in God.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37508:57"/>(For if the Holy Spirit is alſo a Perſon, it is as it implies an Angel aſſiſted by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power; as the Divine Word is a Perſon, meaning thereby the Man Jeſus Chriſt inhabited by the Divine Nature.) We have ſeen that <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> themſelves, <hi>in that Senſe,</hi> acknowledge the Supreme <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and of <hi>the H. Ghoſt;</hi> by the Divine H. Ghoſt meaning the Divine Inſpiration annexed to &amp; communicated by the Angels; &amp; by the Supreme God-head of Chriſt meaning in particular the Divine Wiſdom and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority &amp; Influence of the Divine Power dwelling &amp; acting in and with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>From which it doth not follow, that the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> make the Angels or ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to be God, tho' Chriſt be. For they do not hold, that the God-head in any reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect is moſt intimately United with any Angel, or that the Dignity, Majeſty, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and Wiſdom, as well as Power, that is, the Fulneſs, of the God-head, dwells in any Angel, ſo as that God be in an Angel to be therein Worſhipped, as in a <hi>Schechina</hi> or appointed Token and Symbol of the Divine Preſence; no Angel being conſtituted to repreſent God at the Head of the Univerſe, as Chriſt is, nor what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to God being ſaid to belong to any Angel, who is but a Servant, as it is to Chriſt, who is made the Lord of all.</p>
            <p>No Angel then can be ſaid to be God, tho' Chriſt may, as the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge: And yet they hold, that, as was ſaid, the Divine Power, as well as the Divine Wiſdom, may be ſaid to be God. Now, is it not the Safeſt here, to ſtick to that which is Inconteſtable and Sufficient?</p>
            <p>And is it not Sufficient to acknowledge, that by <hi>the Divine Word</hi> may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>a Divine Power,</hi> Virtue or <hi>Influence</hi> of the <hi>Father;</hi> that the Divine Spirit like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is another <hi>Influence</hi> or Virtue of the <hi>Father;</hi> that the Divine <hi>Word</hi> is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> with <hi>the Firſt-born,</hi> the Word-bearer, or Soul of the Meſſiah; that this Virtue of the Father is ſo much made Chriſt's own, enjoying it as much as his own Soul or his own Reaſon &amp; Power, that it may be look'd upon as Part of his Being, &amp; as always having been even from the Beginning of the World Part of his Being, ſo that the Meſſias may be ſaid to have made all things, inaſmuch as all things were made by that Divine Virtue of the Father, which from the beginning, as was ſaid, was moſt intimately United to the Soul of the Meſſiah; that the Meſſiah is to be honoured, as the Mediator of the New Covenant, exalted to the Government of the Univerſe under God, and as the moſt Glorious <hi>Schechinah,</hi> in whom the Father moſt intimately dwels by an ineffable (tho' not viſibly impoſſible) Virtue or Influence, &amp; in whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is thus willing to be Worſhipped; &amp; that the Divine Spirit, whether or no reſiding in or accompanying ſome Archangel or any Angels, (tho' inconteſtably not requiring to be Worſhipped in any of the Angels, nor devolving any kind of Divine Worſhip to any Angels, as to the Soveraigns of the Univerſe, nor making <hi>a Schechinah</hi> of any of the Angels,) is that Mitacle-Working or Sanctifying Virtue of the Father, which dwells in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as its Temple, (or the Father's Temple, whoſe Virtue the Spirit is,) and which, with the Divine Word, was inſtrumental to the Father, in making all things; as Fire is inſtrumental to the Apothecary in the preparing of all the Compoſitions in his Shop, or as Heat and Light are the Inſtruments by which the Sun operates all things and benefits all the World?</p>
            <p>If the Father implies the whole God-head, as the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> unanimouſly own, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then bedenied but that the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> acknowledge &amp; worſhip the whole God-head,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37508:57"/>And, as I conceive it, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> aſſert, that they worſhip Chriſt ſo much upon the account of the Divine Nature Dwelling in and moſt intimately United with him, that otherwiſe they would not altogether <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſhip him as they do. It follows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that, on the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> part, the Difference cannot be thought to be eſſential or fundamental, or that the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> cannot truly be ſaid to deny the Divinity of Chriſt, or of the Holy Ghoſt. For as touching the Holy Ghoſt, it cannot be denied but that a Divine Virtue &amp; Inſpiration may be meant thereby. And as concerning what the Scholaſtick <hi>Trinitarians</hi> mean by or aſſert of the Divinity of Chriſt, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> own that that Divine Nature, which is moſt intimately United with our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, doth truly belong to the Eternal and Almighty Being, ſo that in that ſenſe Chriſt may be ſaid to be God, tho' properly the title <hi>Chriſt</hi> denotes <hi>the Man</hi> that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſhews on <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. and <hi>Math.</hi> 1.16. The Difference then here is only a Verbal Difference, the Meaning of both Parties at the bottom being in this reſpect the ſame; for when <hi>the Trinitarians</hi> ſay that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>Almighty God, they</hi> do not mean <hi>that the Man is literally the Almighty,</hi> but <hi>that the Divine is moſt ſtrictly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited with the Human Nature.</hi> And this <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> will not deny. 'Tis certain, <hi>the Primitive <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> did not deny it, as was before ſaid. Then,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>We are to inquire, Whether the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians may not joyn in Communion with the Trinitarian Church?</hi> By <hi>three Perſons in one God,</hi> (which term, Perſons, the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> themſelves own to be here not only unſcriptural but even very improper,) may not the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians</hi> mean, as ſome do, three Conſiderations of the Divine Nature, (for inſtance, Divine Mind, Divine Wiſdom, Divine Power,) which are a kind of Modal Perſons, which may be in the ſame Subject, as <hi>Tully</hi> ſays <hi>that a Man may ſuſtain divers Perſons?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſon for the Affirmative is: that for Peace-ſake We muſt be made all things to all Men, ſo far as there is no Divine Law or Prohibition againſt that which We condeſcend to; (<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4, 3;) and that there is no Law againſt the <hi>terming</hi> the Divine Wiſdom and Power <hi>Perſons,</hi> meaning <hi>Modal Perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſons for the Negative are theſe particularly. Not only, by the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, the <hi>Trinitarians</hi> generally mean not ſuch Modal, but rather Real, Perſons, ſo that to mean <hi>ſuch</hi> (ſuppos'd or pretended) Modal Perſons would be a piece of Diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but even this term diſguiſes the Chriſtian Religion, and is contrary to the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and Solemnity of the Divine Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Scripture no where enjoyns us to addreſs Prayers to God the Inſpiration, or to aſſert a Divine Perſon by the Name of God the Holy Ghoſt. Tho' the Holy Ghoſt be taken to imply an Influence of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Virtue, yet God the Holy Ghoſt, and the Inſpiration a Divine Perſon, certainly are not Scriptural Terms. And the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> generally believe, that in ſuch intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Matters, and particularly concerning the Object of Worſhip and the making Something diſtinctly an Object of Worſhip, We muſt not go beyond expreſs Injunctions. According to Scripture, they worſhip Chriſt to the Glory of the Father, as was ſaid. And in particular they ultimately worſhip the Father, for his giving the Divine Inſpiration. The Governors of the Church are humbly deſir'd, to give Publickly their Opinion of theſe &amp; the like aforementioned Reaſons; this undoubtedly being a Subject, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves all the illuſtration, that, according to the Obligations of Chriſtian Charity, they can give to it. Tho' all that is poſſible ought to be done for Peace-ſake, yet, on the other hand, nothing ought to be done againſt Conſcience, and tho' ſome of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> might condeſcend to moſt of the Scholaſtick <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Expreſſions, yet they cannot generally approve them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:37508:58"/>III. <hi>What is inferr'd from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Arguments remains in force, ſo that it is an indiſpenſible Duty to profeſs and eſtabliſh the Goſpel-Terms of Communion, and to keep to the ſeeming and moſt manifeſt and apparent Generality of the Expreſſions of Scripture for Terms of Church-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, tho' the Trinitarians and ſome <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians ſhould opine that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians may with a good Conſcience joyn in Communion with the Trinitarians, and even tho' there were in God what might truly be call'd three Perſons.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) If there be <hi>Somewhats</hi> in God that may be call'd <hi>three Perſons,</hi> (which yet, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſeems abſolutely, both, impoſſible in it ſelf, and not expreſly implied in Scripture, but contrary to many Texts,) yet, not only that Doctrine ſeems <hi>abſolutely unintelligible,</hi> but certainly it is <hi>most obſcurely</hi> revealed and but drawn from moſt intricate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Deductions; and, on the other hand, the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> Arguments, againſt the calling any thing in God three Perſons, are inconteſtably ſuch that Men may be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely inquiſitive and really think them to be ſolid. Upon ſuch moſt abſtruſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, We ought not to act raſhly, and condemn or reject ſincere and inquiſitive Perſons. God cannot be ſuppoſed, indiſpenſibly to require of every one to believe explicitely what he has left ſo difficult and obſcure, nor conſequently to have allow'd any one to determine this Point Magiſterially, ſo as to make the Determination of it a neceſſary Term of Church-Communion. Then it follows, it is God's Will, that, as has been ſaid, in Terms and Acts of Church Union, we ſhould content our ſelves with the Expreſſions and Generality of Scripture: And, ſo, the Human Impoſition of the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> and <hi>Nicene</hi> Creeds, and of Publickly Praying to the Holy Ghoſt, and in Publick Aſſemblies and Church-Service uſing the term <hi>three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> is a piece of Preſumption and Spiritual Tyranny and Oppreſſion. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays not expreſly, that the Son and Spirit are equal to the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) <hi>The Generality of the Scripture-Terms,</hi> as was ſhewn, is undoubtedly <hi>ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</hi> For, tho' God might be ſaid to be three Perſons, yet not only it cannot be thought, as has been remarked, that, under the benign Oeconomy of the Goſpel, God has made that indiſpenſibly Neceſſary, which at leaſt ſeems ſo intricate and obſcure, and about which ſincere and inquiſitive Perſons may miſtake; but, beſides, as was alſo before obſerv'd, when God is worſhipped, is not all ador'd, that is the Object of Divine Worſhip? The <hi>Trinitarians</hi> own, that the (unſcriptural) term, <hi>Perſons,</hi> is us'd ſo improperly of God, that what is meant thereby is moſt unaccountable, &amp; perfectly incomprehenſible. Now that is an invincible Argument, that <hi>that</hi> term is <hi>not neceſſary.</hi> The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> do not deny the Incomprehenſibility of the Divine Nature. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing then, that by the Divine Word and Spirit be meant Somewhats, more then Wiſdom and Inſpiration, (as the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians,</hi> who are not for determining in ſuch obſcure Matters, will not contradict but that it may be ſo,) yet ſeeing that that, whatever it be, is abſolutely unknown &amp; unintelligible, it concerns Us not to aſcribe Names to it, &amp; cannot be indeed the Subject of our diſquiſition. Howbeit, at leaſt, we ſhould take care not to advance any thing, concerning theſe Matters, that appears inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with any Text, but ſhould rather ſtick to that which is ſafe and ſufficient: And, it is certain; the Scripture no where ſays we ſhould Pray to the Holy Spirit in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and it expreſly ſets forth Chriſt as the Mediator betwixt God and Men: ſo that it is inconteſtably ſufficient to come to God thro' the Mediation of Chriſt, and to honour Chriſt as the Mediatory King under God, tho' united to God as intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:37508:58"/>as poſſible, as was ſaid. For tho' all things are ſubjected to Chriſt, yet it is, <hi>to the Glory of God the Father,</hi> and to the end that God may be moſt glorified, and may moſt univerſally and illuſtriouſly reign in and by and thro' Chriſt. So that, in making Chriſt the King of Kings, or the Univerſal King under God, and the Head of the Church, God did not abdicate the Government, or diveſt himſelf of his Majeſty, but ſtill remained ever the Moſt Supreme, and reſerved to himſelf to direct Chriſt, and to favour his Interceſſion, and to receive thro' him the Homages of Men, Chriſt doing all in the Name of God. And, accordingly, the Apoſtles directed their Prayers to God, (<hi>Acts,</hi> 4, 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and commanded the Faithful to addreſs themſelves to him, (<hi>Phil.</hi> 4, 6,) thro' Jeſus Chriſt, (as it is in the following Verſe, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4, 7,) that, in his Name, and thro' his Mediation, they might obtain their Requeſts of the Father, (according to Chriſt's Promiſe, <hi>John,</hi> 14, 13, &amp; <hi>John,</hi> 16, 23, that what they ſhould pray for to the Father, in his Name, he would ſecond by his Interceſſion, &amp; ſo would do it for them, <hi>that the Father might be glorified in the Son.</hi> For our Saviour ſays expreſly, in <hi>John,</hi> 16.23; <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my Name, He will give it you.</hi>)</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The Arguments, for <hi>the Scripture-Terms of Church <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with reſpect to ſuch moſt intricate and abſtruſe Matters as the Platonick or Scholaſtick Speculations concerning the Doctrin of the Holy Trinity, are evermore <hi>ſolid and invincible,</hi> and (as was obſerved) a contrary Method is wholly inconſiſtent with <hi>the Principles of Proteſtants,</hi> which import; That the <hi>Scripture</hi> is a <hi>ſufficient</hi> and <hi>the only</hi> Rule, That there is <hi>no living Magiſterial Judge of Controverſies,</hi> That <hi>Particular Chriſtians</hi> are in ſuch a caſe <hi>to examin and judge for themſelves,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) Many <hi>ſincere and inquiſitive</hi> Perſons may <hi>ſcruple other Terms,</hi> than theſe which are inconteſtably good, ſufficient, and the only warrantable ones, for Terms of Church-Communion, in ſuch abſtruſe and intricate Matters. And, as was ſhewn, it is certain, the term, <hi>three Perſons,</hi> is unſcriptural, and conſequently cannot be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary. Wherefore ſurely Chriſtian Charity obliges us, not to hazard unneceſſarily, in ſuch difficult Matters, the Deſtruction of thoſe Souls for which Chriſt died. Therefore it certainly follows, both; <hi>that</hi> the Scholaſtick <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Determinations and Impoſitions are contrary to God's Will; and <hi>that</hi> it is an indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible Duty to profeſs and eſtabliſh <hi>the Goſpel-Terms of Communion,</hi> which are ſtated and pleaded for in the <hi>Irenicum Magnum,</hi> and in the <hi>Apologia pro Irenico Magno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' <hi>ſome <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> (conſidering <hi>an Influence of the Divine Nature</hi> dwelling <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>an Influence and Act of the Divine Power</hi> implied <hi>in the Holy Spirit or Holy Inſpiration,</hi> and conſidering we are exhorted to keep as much as we can <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit</hi> in the bond of Peace) ſhould carry Chriſtian Condeſcenſion ſo far, as (by their Preſence, ſometime, in the Religious Aſſemblies, for Peace-Sake, till theſe things be duely weighed) to bear with the Uſe of ſome of the Scholaſtick <hi>Trinitarian</hi> Terms; yet, that is at leaſt ſo nice a Point, that <hi>many</hi> conſcientiouſly may with great colour of reaſon abſolutely ſcruple them, and all <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> are obliged to expreſs openly their diſlike of thoſe (in their opinion) at leaſt dubious Terms and raſh Expreſſions, and to appear and profeſs not to repeat ſome of them, and not to aſſent to them, in the Religious Service: (which Condeſcenſion indeed, upon mature Conſideration, ſeems even generally to be more than is wholly warrantable; particularly, one would think, with reſpect to the <hi>Litany,</hi> and the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> and <hi>Nicene</hi> Creeds, according to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37508:59"/>what has hereupon been ſaid; ſo that the Afternoon-Service only can well ſeem tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to them; and indeed 'tis generally reckoned to be no leſs than <hi>Hypocritical Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing,</hi> for any <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian</hi> to carry <hi>the Condeſcenſion farther:</hi>) therefore even the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarians</hi> themſelves, who are perſuaded of the (evident and inconteſtable) Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs and Neceſſity of <hi>the Goſpel Terms of Communion,</hi> are bound to proteſt againſt the impoſing of thoſe ſaid <hi>Scholaſtick Terms, (deviating from the Scripture-Latitude,)</hi> not only as an unneceſſary Burden, but as a grievous and unwarrantable, a pernicious and cruel Oppreſſion, perfectly contrary to the Moderation of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. For has not God intended, there ſhould be <hi>one Catholick Church,</hi> and <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saints?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, <hi>the Scripture-Terms</hi> are <hi>the only Juſt, and Charitable, and Neceſſary Terms of Church Communion.</hi> And they are a <hi>fit Means of Peace:</hi> For, ſo you eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh no other <hi>Terms of Church-Communion</hi> but <hi>ſuch</hi> as are agreable to <hi>the Scripture-Generality,</hi> you may lay any <hi>Penalty</hi> on <hi>expreſs Diſputings in the Religious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe Terms of Church-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> then, both, are <hi>the Scripture-Terms,</hi> and <hi>the only Terms of Communion</hi> that are <hi>agreable to the fundamental Grounds of the Reformation,</hi> or to <hi>the inconteſtable Principles of Proteſtants,</hi> and to <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Moderation,</hi> and they are <hi>the fit and only poſſible Terms</hi> for all Chriſtians, that own the Scripture for their Rule, <hi>to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nite in:</hi> And the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Arguments</hi> are ſo conſiderable, that it muſt be the higheſt Temerity in the World not to be willing to ſtick, in Acts of Communion, to the (<hi>Safe</hi> &amp; <hi>ſuficient</hi>) Generality included in <hi>thoſe Terms.</hi> So that to reject <hi>theſe Terms,</hi> is not only to run the greateſt Hazards to oppreſs the Truth and injure thoſe who are approved of God, but it is expreſly to be guilty of the greateſt Miſchiefs, of disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guring Chriſtianity as if it had no Means of Union, hindering the growth and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Goſpel, and being the Cauſe of endleſs Schiſms and Diviſions. Theſe Matters are ſet into ſo full and inconteſtable a light, that to ſlight and reſiſt ſo great Evidence cannot but be of the greateſt Conſequence to the Souls of them that are therein concern'd. It is credible, God has preſerv'd the World and this Generation for the Sake of this great Light, (moſt illuſtriouſly adorning the Goſpel,) ſo great a Light, that againſt it the Gates of Hell ſhall never be able to prevail, and it will never be poſſible for all the Powers of the Adverſaries of ſo evident Truths to anſwer theſe unanſwerable Arguments. Now then, inconteſtably, Peace is preſented upon juſt Terms, by this Method, which therefore ſhould be moſt carefully conſidered. For if the righteous be oppreſſed, God noteth all things in his Book, and Great Plagues are denounced againſt rejecting a great Light and injuring thoſe that are accepted of God. May We all take effectual Meaſures, to avoid God's Judgments, and to obtain his Mercy and Eternal Salvation!</p>
            <p>I thought here to have finiſhed this <hi>Poſt-Script;</hi> but it may, perhaps, not be unfit to advertiſe, that, ſince the writing of it, I have accidentally met with a ſmall Pamph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, (a 6d.

               <p>If a Doctrin be not ſo revealed but that wiſe and good Men differ in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, it is a clear caſe, it is not <hi>inter Dogmata neceſſaria ſimpliciter,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>The Epiſtle Dedicat.</hi> P. 15.16.)</p>
               <p>It is obſervable, that the reſtraint of Propheſying, impoſing upon other Mens Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and lording it over their Faith, came in with the retinue of Antichriſt, that is, as other Abuſes and Corruptions of the Church did, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>Ib.</hi> P. 18.)</p>
               <p>Let not Men be haſty in calling every diſlik'd Opinion by the Name of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy. (<hi>Ib.</hi> P. 29.)</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> the <hi>Socinians,</hi> the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts,</hi> the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Churches which are all <hi>Neſtorian,</hi> differ from others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Where then ſhall we ſix our Conſidence, or joyn Communion? To pitch upon any one, is to throw the Dice, if Salvation be to be had only in one of them, and that every Error be damnable. We have therefore no other help in the midſt of theſe Differences, but to be all United in that Common Term, which is the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of the Communion of Saints, that is, the Apoſtles Creed, an honeſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to find out what truths we can, and a mutual permiſſion to others that diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree from our opinions. I am ſure this will ſecure us, but I know not any thing elſe that will. (<hi>Ib.</hi> P. 33.)</p>
               <p>If Men muſt be permitted in their Opinions, and Chriſtians muſt not perſecute Chriſtians, there is as much reaſon to reprove all thoſe oblique Arts, ungentle and unchriſtian, and deſtructive of Learning and Ingenuity; as Burning or Suppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Books and Writings of thoſe of different Sentiments, forcing them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is a ſtrange Induſtry, us'd by our Fore-Fathers. Of all thoſe He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies which gave them battle, we have abſolutely no Record or Monument, but what themſelves who were their Adverſaries have tranſmitted to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>Ib.</hi> P. 34.)</p>
               <p>Of the ſame conſideration is Mending of Authors, not to their own mind but to ours. (<hi>Ib.</hi> P. 35.)</p>
               <p>I am not ſure that ſuch an Opinion is Hereſy, neither would other Men be ſo ſure as they think for, if they did conſider it aright, and obſerve the infinite deceptions, and cauſes of deceptions in wiſe Men, and in all doubtful Queſtions, and did nor miſtake Confidence for Certainty. (<hi>Ib.</hi> P. 39.)</p>
               <p>It is of geateſt conſequence to believe right in the Queſtion of the Validity or Invalidity of a Death-Bed Repentance, and the conſequences of the Doctrin of Predetermination are of deepeſt and moſt material conſideration; and yet theſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:37508:60"/>Concernments, where a Laberty of Propheſying in theſe Queſtions has been permitted, have made no diſtinct Communion, no Sects of Chriſtians. (<hi>The Liberty of Propheſying.</hi> P. 3.)</p>
               <p>Salvation is in ſpecial and by name annexed to the belief of thoſe Articles only, which have in them the indearments of our ſervices, or the ſupport of our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or the ſatisfaction of our hopes. (<hi>Ib.</hi> P. 8.)</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles, or their Contemporaries and Diſciples, compos'd a Creed, to be a Rule of Faith to all Chriſtians; which Creed, unleſs it contain'd all the intire object of Faith, and the foundation of Religion, it cannot be imagin'd to what purpoſe it ſhould ſerve; and it was ſo eſteemed by the whole Church of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (<hi>Ib.</hi> P. 9.)</p>
               <p>But if this was ſufficient to bring Men to Heaven then, why not now? If the Apoſtles admitted all to their Communion that believed this Creed, why ſhall we exclude any that preſerve the ſame intire? (<hi>Ib.</hi> P. 11.)</p>
               <p>Neither are we oblig'd to make theſe Articles more particular and minute than the Creed.—For altho' whatſoever is certainly deduced from any of theſe Articles made already ſo explicite, is as certainly true, and as much to be believed as the Article it ſelf, yet becauſe it is not certain that our deductions from them are certain, &amp; what one calls evident, is ſo obſcure to another, that he believes it falſe; it is the beſt and only ſafe courſe to reſt in that explication the Apoſtles have made. (<hi>Ib.</hi> P. 12.)</p>
               <p>But if we go farther, beſides the eaſineſs of being deceived, we relying upon our own diſcourſes, (which tho' they may be true and then bind us to follow them, but yet no more than when they only ſeem trueſt,) yet they cannot make the thing certain to another, much leſs neceſſary in it ſelf. And ſince God would not bind us upon pain of Sin and Puniſhment, to make deductions our ſelves, much leſs would he bind us to follow another Man's Logick as an Article of our Faith. (<hi>Ib.</hi> P. 13.)</p>
               <p>For it is a demonſtration, that nothing can be neceſſary to be believed under pain of Damnation, but ſuch Propoſitions of which it is certain that God has ſpoken and taught them to us, and of which it is certain that this is their ſenſe and purpoſe: For if the ſenſe be uncertain, we can no more be obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it in a certain ſenſe, than we are to believe it at all, if it were not certain that God delivered it, <hi>&amp;c. (Ibid.)</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>[Here, to theſe words, I would only add, that this <hi>Generality</hi> may <hi>ſuffice,</hi> at leaſt, for <hi>Terms of Church-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> and that Men are anſwerable to God, Whether or no they do what lies in their power, to underſtand every Article as well as they can. Howbeit, certainly, fallible Men are not Magiſterially to preſcribe in moſt intricate Matters, or make then their Deductions a Rule, to other Chriſtians. Perhaps the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves knew not all Myſteries, or underſtood not perfectly all the obſcure Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which they had written when they were inſpired; as the Prophets did not always fully conceive the whole Meaning of all their Propheſies and Writings. How ſhould this Conſideration then humble Us, and keep Us from a deciſive, magiſterial and impoſing Spirit!]</p>
            <q>
               <p>And <hi>this</hi> alſo I affirm; altho' the Church of any one denomination, or repreſented in a Council, ſhall make the Deduction or Declaration. (<hi>Ib.</hi> P. 14.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:37508:60"/>Particular Churches are bound to allow Communion, to all thoſe that profeſs the ſame Faith upon which the Apoſtles did give Communion. (P. 262.)</p>
               <p>To refuſe our Charity to thoſe who have the ſame Faith, becauſe they have not all our Opinions which we over-value; is Impious and Schiſmatical, <hi>&amp;c. (Ib.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Meletiant</hi> joined againſt the <hi>Catholicks:</hi> The <hi>Catholicks</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatians</hi> joyned againſt the <hi>Arians.</hi> Now if Men would do that for Charity which they do for Intereſt, it were handſomer and more ingenuous. (P. 263.)</p>
               <p>Men would do well to conſider whether or no ſuch proceedings do not derive the guilt of Schiſm upon them who leaſt think it, and whether of the two is the Schiſmatick? he that makes unneceſſary and inconvenient Impoſitions; or he that diſobeys them, becauſe he cannot without doing violence to his Conſcience ſubmit to them? (P. 265.)</p>
               <p>He that is moſt diſpleaſed at another Man's Error, may be as much deceived in his Underſtanding. (P. 266.)</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Hereſy</hi> is uſed in Scripture <hi>indifferently,</hi> &amp;c. (P. 18.)</p>
               <p>The further the Succeſſion went from the Apoſtles, the more forward Men were in numbring Hereſies, and that upon ſlighter and more uncertain grounds. (P. 32.)</p>
               <p>I am willing to believe their ſenſe of the word <hi>Hereſy</hi> was more gentle than it is now. (P. 39.)</p>
               <p>They whoſe Age and Spirits were far diſtant from the Apoſtles, had alſo other judgments concerning Faith and Hereſy, than the Apoſtles had. <hi>(Ibid.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all the Animadverſions againſt Errors by the Apoſtles, no pious Perſon was condemn'd, no Man that did invincibly err, or <hi>bona mente;</hi> but ſomthing that was amiſs in <hi>genere morum,</hi> was that which the Apoſtles did redargue. (P. 22.)</p>
               <p>If a Man mingles not a Vice with his Opinion, tho' he be deceiv'd in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, his Error is his Miſery, not his Crime; it makes him an Argument of weakneſs and an object of pity, but not a Perſon ſealed up to ruin and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. (P. 24.)</p>
               <p>The Epiſtle of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Arius,</hi> tells the truth, and chides them both.—The Emperor calls their Different a vain piece of a Queſtion, and a fruitleſs Contention.—For tho', ſays he, the Matter be grave; yet, becauſe neither neceſſary, nor explicable, the Contention is trifling.— Chriſtians ſhould not fall at variance upon ſuch Diſputes; conſidering our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are not all alike, and therefore neither can our Opinions in ſuch myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Articles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (P. 45.)</p>
               <p>This Letter was by <hi>Socrates</hi> called <hi>a wonderful Exhortation, full of grace and ſober councels;</hi> and ſuch as <hi>Hoſius</hi> himſelf, who was the Meſſenger, preſſed with all earneſtneſs. (P. 46.)</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles, who beſt underſtood theſe Myſteries, thought it not fit to uſe any words, in their Creed, but the words of Scripture; to ſhew us, that thoſe Creeds are beſt which keep the very words of Scripture, and that that Faith is beſt which has the greateſt Simplicity. If the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers had done ſo too, poſſibly the Church would never have repented it. (P. 47.)</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:37508:61"/>Concerning the Symbol of <hi>Athanaſius.</hi>—Nothing there but Damnation and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing everlaſtingly, unleſs the Article of the Trinity be believed, as it is there with curioſity and minute particularities explained.—Yet I dare not ſay all that are not perſuaded of them, are irrevocably damn'd; becauſe <hi>citra hoc Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolum</hi> the Faith of the Apoſtles Creed is intire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (P. 53, 54.)</p>
